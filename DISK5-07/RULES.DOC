          Welcome to The Rage of the Pit Fiend, a new onliner 
     experience in dungeon exploration.  Other games will come out 
     shortly following the conquests of the evil demon Pit Fiend.
     
                                 The Story
     
     In the land of Cromtenia there has been good fortune of late.  
     The tides of evil have been turned.  Recently, though, there has 
     been trouble.  A renegade wizard named Loran summoned a Pit 
     Fiend through one of his evil sorcerous conjuring.  Together, 
     then teamed up to conquer the world.  They were successful in 
     many cases, wreaking havoc throughout the land.
     
     The King of the land, Lord Ryets, summoned his best knights, 
     white wizards, nimble elves, hearty dwarves, and lawful priests 
     and battled Loran and his Pit Fiend.  They met with several set
     backs but fortunately they were able to force Loran and the Pit
     Fiend into a mighty castle, where they are "holed" up.
     
     Now he has called upon the last of his adventurers (namely the 
     BBS'ers) to finish the Pit Fiend and Loran off as well as all of 
     his minions.  He has offered a grand reward for the person who 
     kills the Pit Fiend and Loran.  
     
     Namely his most beautiful elven princess or half-elven male 
     (depending upon preference/sex) in reward.  This person will 
     also be the future ruler of Cromtenia and great riches will be 
     theirs.......

                                DONATIONS & THE MAKING

     At first I was going to make this thing a partial game, you
     receive half of the dungeon levels until I got money from you or
     something like that.  But unfortunately bad news hit a week or
     so ago and it made me think how I got into programming this
     silly onliner....

     In October of 1989 I wanted to program something big.  Really
     big.  I was basically new to modeming and had absolutely NO idea
     what an onliner was.  Foodfite was a mystery to me.  I was also
     a mediocre programmer, with no concept of crunching code or
     memory size/allocation etc... , this is the first big program
     I have EVER written.

     I started to work on an adventure, similar to what you are about
     to play.  I worked hard but to no avail.  Things were just not
     working.  Then I met Mike.   I told him what I wanted to do
     and I told him I thought I wanted to make an onliner,
     so that people could play a quality adventure without
     having to pay the $50.00 to buy a game.  I took it upon myself
     to make such a game, a game people would enjoy, and a game where
     people would call to play it.

     At first it was called King Lagor's dungeon, had a crazy little
     plot and all, but finally it boiled down to Pit Fiend's
     Onliner.  At first things were tough, the 64K source limit kept
     hitting me, and I still hadn't learned how to do overlays.  After
     several months of condensing, shortening, and making data files etc
     I finally got it all together....

     Mike's phone was ringing quite a bit during those months,
     and even the last month before this game's release, his phone
     was ringing with me exclaiming, "Hey, guess what I added and it
     works perfectly!"  There was also many times that I was going to
     abort the project.  It seemed that he was the only one who felt I
     could do it during those early months -- and that meant very
     much to me.

     Anyhow, Mike was constantly getting calls from me.  I was telling
     him what I had added and what I had taken out.  And he
     listened...

     Without Mike to whom I left E-mail to or just call to say
     hello and see what was up; would've made this game very
     difficult, if not impossible to program.  His comments,
     suggestions,and much need encouragement got me through this
     program, and when the Beta version was floating around the South
     Bay here, he was still giving plenty of advice and compliments
     about my creation .

                                  Page -3-

     Anyhow, early in March of this year, writing, he passed away.  I was
     shocked and very upset.  I almost trashed my game when I heard the news. 
     I miss the calls to his house the ones where I would be telling him 
     about the progress of The Game....

     I will miss Mike and his help when I do the sequel.  That is why
     I am requesting that if you play this game, and enjoy it or
     whatever, to send a donation of greater than $5.00 to the
     address shown below.  The money will go to prevent suicides in 
     the area or or help troubled people.  This donation should be 
     tax deductable as well.

     This is the least I can do in remembering him and hope that your
     donation can fight the waste of life.
     
     
       P.F. 3/20/1990
     
     
     Any donation in excess of $20.00 will receive a copy of ALL the 
     source code, to modify as you please, IF it is requested.  It 
     will be sent via US Postal Service on a Floppy disk (5 1/4

     $1.00 to cover postal charges and the floppy disk.

                         How do I play this thing?
     
     First of all you must generate a character.  At the main menu 
     hit 'C'.  You will then be presented with 8 or so different 
     stats:  Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), 
     Coordination (CRD), Health (HTH), Personality (PER), Spell 
     Points (SPT) and Luck (LCK).  Each score ranges from 05-25.  5 
     is the worst and 25 is the best.  You will also be presented 
     with a choice of classes.
     
     STR -- How strong you are -- the stronger you are, the more 
     damage you can deal out.
     
     INT -- Good for Magic Users that's about it.
     
     WIS -- Modifies a cleric's chances of turning.
     
     CRD -- Modifies your Armor Class and a Thieve's Chance of doing 
     double damage.  Also helps out in traps.
     
     HTH -- Health modifies how many hit points you get when you 
     start or gain a level.
     
     PER -- Personality affects how people react to you.
     
     SPT -- For magic Users, determines how many times you can cast a 
     spell (see Staves)
     
     LCK -- Modifies saving throws.
     
     1)  Fighter -- you can always be a fighter, just make sure you 
     are strong!
     
     2)  Magic User -- Them and Elves are the only ones to use 
     Staves.
     
     3)  Priests -- awesome power against undead, decent fighting 
     skills, easy level gaining.
     
     4)  Rogue -- Very High Initiative, good weaponry, decent armor, 
     very easy levels to be gained, good fighting, most moves per 
     day.  Also there is a chance he will do double damage every time 
     he hits.
     
     5)  Elf -- Awesome, hard to get, hard to gain levels, can use 
     magic, very good weapons, okay armor.
     
     6)  Dwarf -- ultra fighter.  Excellent weaponry + armory, hard 
     to gain levels, very powerful....
     
     Note Magic is VERY powerful in this game, but woe be it to any 
     magic user whose spells do not work so well......
     
     You are allowed TEN rerolls per DAY.  Choose a class and begin 
     adventuring or else call back the next day and try again....
                                  Page -5-

     You are allowed to reroll a character as many times as you want, 
     you just can't roll more than 10 times in one day!
     
                                  The Bank
     
     Here is a nice safe place for you to place your gold.  The 
     Deposit command allows you to deposit money into your account.  
     To see your account hit 'Y'.  To withdrawal money hit the 'W'.  
     Your money will be accessible even in the dungeons!  There are 
     several banks operating on each level so that you can place or 
     get money even in there!  
     
     It is a good idea to put money in there because when a character 
     kills you (another BBS'er) he will take 50% of your gold!  Also 
     when you flee from monsters they will take some also!  But it is 
     a good idea to have some in case you run into the general stores 
     on the dungeon levels!
     
                             The General Store
     
     The General Store is your place to purchase weapons, magic 
     staves, and armors!  Geron runs the establishments and sells his 
     wares for no cheap cost.  He also sells Magic Items, which can 
     only be bought.  Depending upon which level of the dungeon you 
     are on he will sell you a magic armor or weapon of varying 
     power!  (i.e. you can find a +2 Broad Sword on Level 2 etc..)  
     Of course they will be MUCH more expensive.
     
     Armor
     
     Armor protects you from the viciousness of the monsters that 
     wander about!  Armor also has its drawbacks, especially the very 
     heavy ones.
     
     Depending upon your class, you will have several choices of the 
     types of armors you can have.  There are several things to note 
     about armor:
     
        1)  Cost -- the more expensive the armor the better it is
        2)  Protective Value -- the more the better
        3)  Magical Bonus -- increases Protective Value.
        4)  Movement Hinderence -- if you have heavy armor, you won't 
     be able to move around as fast as a person who doesn't have as 
     much armor....
        
     Armor is considered worn at all times and can be found in the 
     "Equipped Armor " type during a View character scan.  You start 
     the game with no armor.
     
     Weapons:
     
     You will definitely need these.  There are two types of weapons, 
     missile weapons and melee weapons.  Melee weapons can only be 
     
                                  Page -6-

     used in close combat (see Combat section).  While Missile 
     weapons can only be used in missile combat.  You have an 
     unlimited amount of ammunition for missile weapons.
     
     Here are some facts about weapons:
        1)  Cost -- usually the more expensive the more damage they 
     can deal out.
     
        2)  Two Handed Weapons -- you can use these but if you have a 
     shield it will not count towards your armor class, although, you 
     still we be able to carry a shield.
     
        3)  Magical Bonus -- as armor except this modifies your 
     chances of hitting and doing damage.
     
     Magic Staves:
     
        Only Mages and Elves are allowed to purchase this section.  
     Others may only look and stare......  Each staff can deal out a 
     lot of damage and affect ALL monsters during combat, although 
     monsters are allowed a saving throw.   You are limited to the 
     use of these staves by your spell points (MPS).  You regain 
     spell points by resting.
     
         1) Cost --  the more a staff costs the more damage it can 
     do.  
      
         2) Damage -- this is the maximum amount of damage this staff 
     can do.  Divide this number by 8 to get the MINIMUM amount of 
     damage this staff can do.  Successful saving throws will halve 
     the amount of damage incurred.
     
         3)  Success Chance -- This is a percentage (base) which is 
     modified by your level, intelligence, and a few other factors.  
     If you fail to cast a spell successfully, you will loose the 
     spell points (MPS) that were neccessary to cast the spell.  
     Usually the lower staves on this list have the highest chance of 
     success but do less damage compared to the more powerful ones.
     
         4)  Spell Point Cost -- this is the amount of points 
     necessary to cast the spell.  If you do not have the spell 
     points neccessary to cast the spell, you will not be able to use 
     the staff.  
     
     Monsters can cast spells too.  There spells are equivalent to 
     your staves in most respects......
     
     MPS -- Magic Points (or Spell Points) are like hit points, 
     except if you run out of these you will not die.  It is VERY 
     good to have a large amount of MPS's if you are a spell casting 
     character.

                                 The Tavern
     
     Here is a place for you to pass the time away and drink and 
     gamble.  Drinks are expensive but you can hear some interesting 
     rumors (sometimes) while you pass the time away.
     
     Gambling is also legal.  Slots and Dice Games are very common 
     here.  Dice is usually played by more than 2 people.  The one 
     who rolls the highest takes the pot.  If any two tie, then 
     everybody takes their share of the pot back and the game 
     restarts.  Slots are fairly self explanatory.
     
                                ADVENTURING
     
     This section includes the topics of dungeon exploration and 
     combat.  This too is a very important section.
     
     DUNGEON EXPLORATION
     
     The dungeons are based in IBM extended characters.  Here are 
     some special characters for you to keep an eye out for:
     
     A -- The General Store -- yes there are general stores in the 
     dungeon to keep you well equipped with magical items.
     
     B -- The Bank -- deposit or withdrawal your money from here.
     
     C -- Another Character  -- This is a fellow BBS'er.  If you move 
     on to the same space as him/her you will be asked if you wish to 
     get into combat.  If you decline, you are allowed to send a 
     message to this person (up to 80 chars).  This DOES NOT consult 
     the Trashcan.TXT.  If you decline to send a message, the program 
     will automatically send one to this person saying that you 
     passed them and DID NOT attack them.  If you attack them you 
     will also be able to send a message to them (if you win), if you 
     do not send a message, the program will send the above to 
     him/her but without the "NOT".
     
     Character vs Character combat is just like other combat, except 
     if you win, you will be rewarded by a percentage of your 
     opponent's gold.  No harm will come to the other player except a 
     percentage of their gold gone.  Be sure and hide your character 
     by staying away from places that are near stairs etc....
     
     
     D -- Door -- most doors go to into rooms.  You will instantly be 
     put into combat with up to four monsters.  You can always 
     continuously reenter a room, but this is NOT recommended because 
     you will miss many of the important sections of the dungeon.
     
     H -- Buy Potions -- a little gnome will sell you potions.
     
     S -- Stairs -- all stairs go up.
                                  Page -8-

     T -- Tavern -- that's where you want to go to take a break!
     
     Signs-- (ANSI character), looks like an upside-down J or L.  
     These are VERY Important and contain clues about the game.  Try 
     typing alt-226 to see what I mean, read these at all costs!
     
     Up side down '!''s are talking statues, if you can touch them.  
     They can offer gifts .. for a price.
     
     A funny looking F (an integral sign) is a fountain.  Again if 
     you can reach this thing, it will give you MANY benefits.  But 
     it does have its drawbacks -- the more you use it the more 
     chance of something terribly EVIL of happening to you may take 
     effect.......
     
     #, P, and other symbols NOT mentioned above are EXTREMELY 
     special and should be met with caution, because of THEIR great 
     importance.  
                                  Page -8-

     To ease movement, it is suggested that you keep you NUM-LOCK key 
     on.  Do NOT overfill the buffer, you may accidently walk into 
     something you don't want OR you will repetitively walk into a 
     wall and decrease your movement for the day.  
     
     Magic Mouths:
     
     These things appear at random and often times say very strange 
     things to people.  After reading it, you will be allowed to 
     change it.  The next person that encounters the Magic Mouth will 
     read what you had said.  So don't be nasty about it....
     
     Strange Numbers:
     
     Yes, on one particular level there are some strange numbers 
     being given out.  But they are unique for every player.  Just 
     because you have found yours, doesn't mean that they are the 
     same for the next player!  Enjoy that puzzle....
     
     Strange Encounters:
     
     Yes there are some wondering encounters for you to fight.  Also 
     there are some strange findings that will randomly pop up.  
     Traps are also abound.  Just be ready for them, and make sure 
     your hit points are in good order!
     
     Whenever you take a step in the dungeon there is a chance that 
     you will have rested enough to restore 1 hit point AND 1 magic 
     point.
     
                              Special HotKey!
      
     By hitting the Letter 'Z' while inside the dungeon, will 
     teleport you back to level 0, the town, use only when necessary!
     
                                   COMBAT
     
     Combat is a very essential part of the game.  It is necessary to 
     fight and quite often you will be harassed by a group of 
     wandering monsters in the dungeon.  Some of these encounters 
     will be harder than others.  Most monsters are can be guessed 
     (through previous experiences in other fantasy role playing 
     games), but learning the strengths and weaknesses of other 
     monsters are up to you.  
     
     How to Fight:
     
     1)  When you encounter a group of monsters, you will be put into 
     the combat mode.  You will find yourself engaged by up to four 
     monsters.  These monsters will attack until either you kill them 
     or they kill you, whichever comes first......

     2)  You will be prompted by a (1234MPRTUX) prompt.  Here is what 
     they mean:
     
     1 .. 4 mean attack a monster (depending upon which position)
     
     M .. change the Missile/Melee status of the monsters (see next 
     section)
     
     P .. do nothing that turn
     
     R .. Run away, you will loose 25% of any or all gold you are 
     carrying, but it you will escape with your life.
     
     T .. if you are a Priest you will be able to turn undead 
     creatures.  You can only turn once per combat and is the chance 
     of success is based on your wisdom and Priestly level.
     
     U .. Use Staff, magic users will be able to cast a spell at this 
     time.  The chance of success is based upon your level and 
     intelligence.
     
     X .. Drink a Potion -- hope you have one before you hit this 
     key!
     
                               Missile/Melee
     
     Yes, this game has a difference between melee and missile 
     weapons.   Be sure and buy at least one melee and one missile 
     weapon.  Monsters will often times have missile weapons also, 
     which they will often use.  
     
     When you attack the program checks to see whether the monster is 
     in melee or missile in RELATION to you.  If you are in missile 
     combat you will use your missile weapons while if you are in 
     melee you will be using you melee weapon.  
     
     To force all monsters to go back to missile (like monsters 
     without missile weapons) hit the M key.  The program will ask 
     you whether you wish the monsters to all go to missile or 
     melee.  Choose the appropriate.  
     
     Spells are multi ranged and so is turning.  That is it doesn't 
     matter where the monster is located.
     
                                  Potions
     
     There are eight different kinds of potions.  
     
     Potions of Healing will heal you 3-18 hit points per draught.  
     You can use these instead of resting or in a dire combat 
     situation.
     
     
                                 Page -11-

     Potions of Spell Point Restoration:  This will restore 3-18 
     spell points, very important if you are a magic user.
     
     Potions of Strength, Intelligence, Luck, and Coordination:
     These will increase the appropriate ability for one call, or 
     until you walk into a bank or armory.  The most you can modify 
     your strength is by 15, so don't drink too much.  
     
     Time Distortion:  Once per call you will be allowed to drink ONE 
     of these.  It will give you an additional 50 moves.
     
     Liquid Gold:  These are like walking banks.  Buy them at 550 gps 
     and use them to make 500 gps.  No profit, but if a character 
     kills you, he won't be able to get these from you, and that 
     includes the monsters also.
     
     The most you can have of any one type of potion is 255.  Trying 
     to buy more than the allotted amount, will just give you 255.
     
                              Character Table
     
     This handy little thing occurs when you quit the game.  It will 
     give you a list of the players in the game, their class, level, 
     and dungeon level!  That way you can determine if you are 
     lagging behind or way ahead of the pack!  It will also show if 
     somebody has won or not.
     
     
                            Tips and Suggestions
     
     It is suggested that players do the following:
     
     1)  Read all signs that you encounter.
     2)  Fight often but do not over do it this will get tiring after
         a while, there is plenty to do in the dungeons.....
     3)  Each level has a guardian, learn about them well....
     4)  Buy magical stuff as soon as possible, it is very important.
     5)  Do not always kill other players, as this will most likely
         provide a very stale game as well as a lot of hostilities.
     6)  Equip your character before going into the dungeon,
         otherwise you will become a very dead adventurer.
     7)  Don't put all of your money in the bank, you may need it
         later....
     8)  Find the numbers in the dungeon, level 1.
