                          INSTALLATION AND SYSOP NOTES

                                      For

                            PIT FIEND'S ADSVENTURE!

     How to Install:

       Pit Fiend's Onliner comes with many files.  Most of them are
     Dungeon Files or Data files.  It will create more as the game is
     being played, such as *.SAV and *.MSG files.  It is recommended that
     you read this carefully so that you can save Hard Disk Space and
     organize your hard Drive Correctly.

     Settup up the Chain.

       Batch File:
         This game performs best with SHRINK method.  It is not
         required, but it does work best!  Therefore if you wish
         to put this game in its own sub-directory you must do the
         following things to assure that it can access all of the files.

       1.  Create a batch file called PIT.BAT.  By typing COPY CON
           PIT.BAT at the dos prompt in the WWIV sub directory.
           Then type the following things:

           a.  CD\XXXXXXX <---- whatever you decide to name the
               sub directory

           b.  PITONL %1

           C.  cd.. (back to the WWIV directory!)

           d.  Ctrl-Z (don't actually type words but just CTRL-Z!)

       2.  This will save the batch file.

     Now make a chain using Chain edit which will call PIT.BAT by
     typing the following chain c:\wwiv\pit %1.  When pit.bat is called
     it will then change directories to the one you out the adventure in
     and call it, passing the parms.


     Telegard users and others will have to figure out how to do it
     themselves, as I am not experienced with those systems....

     Initializing the Game:

        This will make sure that the game has not been tampered with or
        a previous user's locations aren't saved.  Type REROLL in DOS.

        This will refresh the location and table data files.  It will
        also erase all files ending in the extension *.SAV and *.MSG -->
        VERY IMPORTANT.  The game will also periodically destroy *.MSG
        files so be sure that you subs don't end in the extension *.MSG
        (if they are in the same sub directory as the onliner).

        You can also run CMMOUTH.COM to renew the magic mouth incase
        you don't like what somebody said!

     Chain Requirements:

        This game uses the default for DOS interrupts, which I believe at
        the present moment is yes.  You must use Shrink.  You config.sys
        file must have the string DEVICE = ANSI.SYS in it.  ANSI is a
        requirement for this game!!!!!!  People who can't support ANSI
        will have grave misgivings about the game, as it will shoot
        garbage all over the screen.  It is recommended that 300 baud
        not be allowed to play for obvious reasons....

     Boards Over 750 users!

     If your board has more than user number 750 please do the following:
        1)  Donate at least $5.00 to the address below and tell me how
            many users you do have and I will fix the data files to be
            much bigger.  Send a Xerox copy of the endorsed/cancelled
            check to me.

        2)  Make sure that users who's user number is over 750 cannot
            play the game....

        The data files are 750 records and if use 751 comes along....
        unknown amounts of damage can be done....

     Source Code:

         The Source code will be available (everything!) for donators
         who contribute atleast $20.00.  This allows you to modify the
         game in any way.  Although, you cannot distribute it.  If you
         feel that your game is not working correctly, donate atleast
         $5.00 to the address below and I will send you untampered with
         data files and COM files.  This game has run under all WWIV
         boards.

         The game was programmed using Turbo Pascal 3.0, therefore
         ownership of Turbo Pascal is a requirement for purchase of
         the source code.  The game will NOT compile with newer versions.

         Donators also will be kept informed on how progress of the
         sequal, Pit Fiend's Revenge, and will receive upgrades as
         the come out...

                                    Page -2-
         Knowledge of Turbo Pascal is a requirement also for the source
         code, it comes with very little commentation but it should be
         fairly easy to follow.....

     Notes on Files:

        If a user is deleted off your board or decides never to call
        again, or just doesn't want to play do NOT delete the character
        buy conventional ways.... This could cause File Not Found and
        Run Time Errors....

        Use the Character Editor to destroy them, entitled VIEWCHAR.EXE
        Viewchar is meant to be used for these reasons, or for cheating.

        Also you can delete any *.MSG files (they will ocntinue to
        grow in size until the reader reads them) without any hestitation
        by using DOS's erase command.

        Note that #.SAV and #.MSG files are saved by the character's
        user number.  Make sure you know the character's user number.

     Notes on Viewchar.EXE

        This is not an onliner program, it will hang the board if it is
        used as one.  Viewchar allows the sysop or anyone else for that
        matter at the keyboard to modify there character to drastic
        measures.... having given one of my characters a 200 strength,
        made me nearly invincible.  I suggest using it with caution.

        It was made to repair characters who had been hurt by a bug or
        just wanted to get a helping hand.  A score greater than 20 in
        an attribute is very good.

        Viewchar should be handled with care, giving a character an
        massive amount of anything will spoil the user's ability to enjoy
        the game!  If you find the monsters are too tough or you want
        a "walk-thru" character use it!  It will not allow you to modify
        a character's dungeon location, as this is a confusing process
        which most likely you will screw up on and put the character in
        a nonexistant dungeon OR in a dungeon where he can't escape!

        When running Viewchar be sure that it can get to all the *.DAT
        files in the sub directory, it will need to load all the potions
        and weapons (etc).  Naturally it must have access to the the
        *.SAV files!
