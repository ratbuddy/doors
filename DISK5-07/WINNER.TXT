Congratualations, you are a winner!  If you haven't donated yet be sure
and do so!  The Pit Fiend will be back in the sequal which will be
bigger and better.  Glad you played it through and see ya in Pit Fiend II.

If you have donated and wish to have your name in the sequal as a
Non Player Entity, please let me know.  Remember, since you have
finished the game, you should probably donate if you haven't already
done so!

P.S.  Don't try to play again, it will not work for you anymore.  If
you wish to play again, be sure and ask the SYSOP to delete this character,
using viewchar.exe.  This will allow you to play again!  But you will
also lose your winner status!
