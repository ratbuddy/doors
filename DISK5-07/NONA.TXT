Inside the heavily scented room stands a very pretty woman!  Reclining
on a pile of fine rugs she sits in the lotus position.  She is very
inticing, yet very beautiful, beautiful beyond comparision, even
to the elves...

She becons you to come, to she begins to babble about rescuing her.  Her
long blonde hair falls gently over her bare chest.  You begin to walk
forward, quite enticed by her beauty and her love!

She gets out of her meditative position and stands, her position revealing
everything.  The room begins to feel smug and the aroma of heavily
scented candles is getting sickening!  You feel very dizzy.

You are able to get to her and you nearly collapse as you fall into her
shapely arms.  "Poor baby, trying to kill my husband was a very foolish
thing...  I forgive you though, I love you, I need you, and I will
protect you...  She bends down to give you a kiss and large fangs appear
on her mouth!  Her hair becomes matted and ugly.  You jump back in
horror as she begins to close for the kill!
