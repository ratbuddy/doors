As you push the great doors inward a silence fills the room.  Inside the
room is a collection of dark robed wizards.  Candles fill the room which
cast horrible shadows along the walls.  In the center of the room is the
most horrible sight though.  There, in the middle of a giant, unholy
pentagram stands the Pit Fiend.  Standing taller than your wildest
expectations of him.

Suddenly, a sound brakes through the icey silence.  A tiny vial crashes to
the ground, as the echo of broken glass fills the room!  The mighty Pit
Fiend, looks down and notices that this glass has broken the stones
around the barrier to his freedom!  "Muhahhah!  Now I am free Loran,
there is nothing you can do to stop me.... Utter domination is MINE!".

Loran, the with great indifference answers, "You are Fooled Pit Fiend,
that barrier will hold you, and I COMMAND you to do my WILL!  Kill the
intruder now!  I COMMAND thee!"

The Pit Fiend merely chuckles as his mighty arms sweep outside of the
protective circle to catch up several of the Loran's assistants.  "You
command me to do what?" he says as he rends the apprentices to shreds.

You then begin to bravely engage into combat with the wizards.  As you
get to the first one, Pit Fiend suddenly disappears with a loud poof
as you face Loran and his friends!
