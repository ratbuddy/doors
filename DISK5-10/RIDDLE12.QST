[39m[8C[0;1m"Many years hundreds of years ago I came down to this place to
    do battle against Pit Fiend.   I remember the day so well, I came
    to the place below, in the middle of the dust bowl.  I encountered
    him there!

[8C"I fought very well but was unable to conquer Pit Fiend.... his
    Death Angels overwhelmed even my skills as a swordswoman.  As I
    lay dying I remember the Gods standing near me, ready to take me
    into the heavens where I was being called to.

[8C"The Gods, though, realized that the balance was upset, I was
    the good in the world and Pit Fiend was the evil.  With evil the
    stronger at that moment they realized something must be done.....

[8C"Pit Fiend was granted one wish by the Gods if he would be killed.
    Knowing that he couldn't be killed permanently on the material world
    Pit Fiend made his wish most carefully!"......
