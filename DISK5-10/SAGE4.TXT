

  Upon entering squalor domains of Somaville you are striken immediately
 with a sick feeling.  All about you is trash and filth.  Children and
 adults of all ages fill the streets, armed with clubs, knives, and
 dressed in rags.  Looking around you see fighting, arguing, and the
 remains of hapless victims of thievery.

  Luckily, you are well armed and the welcome at best can be described
 as very cold.  The citizens stare at you as you approach the only house
 at the end of the town.

  Inside the hovel is a smug fat man.  To each side are two lank henchman.
 Dizzied by Soma, the dealer smiles at you and your fat purse.  The two
 henchman stand behind him now and place their hands on their swords, now
 worried that you plan to rob the leader.

 The fat man named Olaff says, "Are you interested in Purchasing Something
 or are you here for a few laughs", Olaff then chuckles along with his
 dirty henchman.  The Conversation starts!
