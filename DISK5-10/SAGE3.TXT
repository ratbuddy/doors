     Raelizini, slowly closes the book and says, Remember those words
my friends.  You are are only hope of sending Mojave back yet for another
1000 years.

     She warns:  Beware of Mojave, he is your most threatening and most
powerful foe, next to Pit Fiend of course.   You will find traps and
guardians of very evil nature.  Your adventuring skill is up against
the best and most wise architects.  Little is known on how many levels
the tower has, but more than likely from five to seven!

    The tower is located in the northeast peninsula.  It is not hard to
find!  Be sure to talk to the Tower Keepers prior to leaving for the words!
Just follow the coastline on the east side, you'll get there!  Also if
you have already forgotten the words feel free to drop by.....

    Good luck!  Since you have little use for the glasses you let her
keep them (she already claimed them as her own anyways).....
