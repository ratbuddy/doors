


I fly upon wings of light,
toward the lofty heavens,
to where I belong,
with the rest of the choir and the mighty Gabriel.

I am pure goodness not evil,
as pure as the driven snow,
where the innocent children play.

I guard thee and guide thee,
to fight the evil that disturbs thy Gods's sleep.
There are others who appear as ones of light,
alas, they deceive thee, they represent Death or the Nite,


I am your Guardian ?????
