         Wandering the lands endlessly,
         looking for stories to share.
         With those that have gold to spare.

         I play my harp and lute,
         singing songs of tribute,
         to the heros of past,
         I bring glory to those who have taken to the next...

         My songs are both bad and good,
         Some people call me a Charlatan,
         others a troubador,
         But my profession is a ????
