   I bring peace to you and to all mankind.

   I am a symbol and I am a bird,
   My prey is the evil and the darkness,
   to them I show no delight.  But to those
   of goodness I bring hope!

   Unlike others birds I am peaceful,
   so peaceful that my name rhymes with LOVE.

   What am I, ????
