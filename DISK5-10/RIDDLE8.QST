[39m[5C[0;1mAs you approach the entrance to the barren canyons of Ladera you find
yourself held back by a strong force!  The winds pick up and a howl echos
from deep within the mountains.  Dark clouds form and the distant sound of
thunder can be heard.

[5CWhite forms materalize to either side of you as you quickly grab your
weapon!  "Peace to you!", cries one of the forms!

[5C"Who are you", you mumble out loud.

[5C"Silence!  We are the Judges of Ladera and we only let the innocent
enter!  Please be patient while we determine your innocence based upon your
recent actions in your current lifetime......."

[5CThe Judges begin to debate and haggle.  Finding nothing better,
you wait patiently for their decision as to whether you will be allowed
to enter or not.
