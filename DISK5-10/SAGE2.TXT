[0;1mMojave.  The only way to stop him was to go through this horrible maze of
death and traps and guardians to the top.

Eventually a sage by the name of "AURAK DRACO" came up with a simple
yet efficient chant to send Mojave back to send Mojave back to the
planes of Hell.  The problem was getting to the top of the tower
admidst the traps, puzzles, and monsters!

Many tried and all but one failed.  A fighter of great reknown, General
Zennora, successfully made it to the top and chanted the words before
the mighty Mojave could kill him.  The General could remember very little
as to what occurred to him inside the tower, other than shudder
when talking as to what occurred inside the domain of evil.

The words that Aurak Draco are not permanent.  They merely last 1000 years
before the Mighty Mojave returns once again for his vengence.  Recorded
here for future generations sake are the words to send Mojave back to the
planes of Hell: "[33mBAC[37m", "[33mBEG[37m", "[33mLOY[37m".

When you first meet Mojave chant these words! Do [5;31mNOT [0;1mbe tempted by his wicked
nature, he is most cunning....."
