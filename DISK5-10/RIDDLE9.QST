[39m[2C[0;1mIn a grove of trees you can hear a chirping bird.  The only sound
in the whole place!  You walk forward into the trees when the bird
chirps out, "Who is that, ack, Visitors?"  The bird continues to whistle
and chirp.  You spy it and realize it is a small sparrow, yet how is it
able to talk?

  You hesitantly say, "Tis an Adventurer, merely searching this foul
denizen for the Evil Pit Fiend!", finding it quite disalarming talking
to a bird.....

  "He can be found, far to the West, at Dragon's Point.  I know of him
and his foul ways, alas he cannot touch me in this sanctuary nor his
evil Death Angels.  Ack....  I have seen where he lives and know much more
about his location...."

  Considering the possibilities, you decide to talk to the bird further!
