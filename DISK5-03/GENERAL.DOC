     (1-3) Active Change:  This will change the active player.  It
     is like all other active changes.  The person must be alive.

     The listing will come up in the upper right hand corner of

     NOT magical.

     (E)quipview:  This will give you a brief account as to
     what the active player is carrying in terms of weapons and
     armor.  Remember, any weapon you purchase OVERWRITES
     the old one!

     (W)eapons:  Like armor, all weapons are NOT magical.  The listing
     of available weapons appear in the upper right hand corner of the
     screen.  Prices are to the right of the names.  There
     are two types of weapons, missile and melee.  Slings and Bows
     are missile weapons and have a category of their own.  While
     as all other weapons are melee weapons.

     This information contains such the following bits of information:

     Cost : Cost in Gold Pieces
     Min. Strength : Minimum Strength to Wield the Weapon
     Protection    : Protection (if armor), the higher the better
     Min. Damage   :       Max. Damage   :
     # of Attacks  : Number of attacks per round of combat.

     Note:  Any CLASS can wear any armor or any weapon up to
     the limitations applied by their strength.  Other limitations
     may apply during special situations. (thieves with plate mail
     trying to X-ray a door etc).

     (P)urcahse an Item:  Purchase a weapon or armor.  You will
     be asked if you indeed wish to purchase the weapon or armor.

     (S)ell an Item:  Sell a weapon.  You will be asked which
     of your possessions you wish to sell.  The general store
     owner will confirm the price is okay with you prior to selling it
     to you.
