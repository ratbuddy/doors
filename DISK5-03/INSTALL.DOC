     To install Pit Fiend Volume 3 you must note the following:

        1)  This game requires that the caller have ANSI.  Ansi
            is therefore required.  Be sure also that you have
            the following command in your CONFIG.SYS file:
                DEVICE = ANSI.SYS (ANSI.sys may vary from DOS to DOS)
            After adding this line, reboot the maching.  Type
            the following : TYPE TITLER2.ANS.  If the title screen
            comes up in color and shows the credits then your machine
            supports ANSI.  If it doesn't then you cannot play it
            locally.  Consult your DOS manual for details.

        2)  This game is NOT complete.  The game comes with roughly
            60-80% of the quest available.  You must register
            it to receive the complete game.  You are welcome to run
            the unregistered version for as long as you like, but
            certain limitations will occur for long time players
            (level limits, dungeon limits, etc).

        3)  It is important that players no that they MUST read
            the documentation, called PIT3DOCS.ZIP.  Please
            make G-Files or put in a download section.

        4)  It is HIGHLY NOT recommended that 300 baud users players
            play this game.  Even 1200 may need to be curtailed.

        5)  This game is written for WWIV 4.XX boards ONLY.  Attempting
            to run the game on other systems than WWIV 4.XX is
            futile.  Contact me:

            If you know the following:

                  How your BBS software checks for hangups (WWIV
                  automattically does this in chains).
                  How to pass usernumbers, that's all this game needs.

            If you don't know how these things work then don't bug me.
            Try to include a source code for an onliner, that would also
            help.

        6)  The sysop should also note that the game doesn't get
            very much bigger on its own, meaning that you once
            you install it, it is installed and doesn't use too much
            more disk space.  Saved Characters though roughly take
            up 1K of space EACH.  Ask your players to delete themselves
            from the game if they decide to quit permantly.  Erasing
            [USERNUMBER].SAV files can be down manually through DOS
            without problems.  Tampering with files is NOT recommended.

        7)  To install the game you must create a batch file, create
            it by typing the following at a DOS prompt:

               C:\WWIV>copy con PIT3ADV.BAT
                    cd pit3
                    pit3adv %1
                    cd.. (Ctrl - Z)
               C:\WWIV>

            The pit3 subdirectory can be anywhere on your harddrive,
            just make sure that your batch file changes to the
            appropriate drive and sub directory.
            Unzip all of the distribution ZIP file into this subdirectory.
            Make sure ALL files are there.
            Put the Batch file, PIT3ADV.BAT in your WWIV directory
            (wherever that may be).
            In your CHAINEDIT thing, just put for a file name:
                C:\WWIV\PIT3ADV %1
            Of course C:\wwiv may be different etc.

        8)  The Shrink method is NOT required to run this game.  Using
            the shrink method will only delay the return time and starting
            time of playing.

        9)  Utilities for viewing maps, editing saved characters can
            be gotten FREE with a registered game.  They are NOT
            included in this package.

       10)  DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT!!! assume that anything from
            PF1 or PF2 will work in this game.  In other words
            do not copy characters from either of these game, or
            ANY files to this game from previous games.  It will
            basically %^%&#@^$&% up the system with I/O errors
            and shoot garbage all over the place and probably lock
            up your system and god knows what else.  SO don't do it.

       11)  Systems with registered copies of PF2 will find that
            VIEW.COM (or VIEW.EXE) will WORK with PF3 maps.  Use
            them freely and thanks once again for registering the game.

       12)  Bugs, Problems, and SNAFU's.  If any these occur, or you
            have problems contact me.  I am more than glad to help
            out, especially for folks who have problems setting
            up the game.  The most common problem is not putting
            the lame %1 thing in there, so be sure you have that.
            Optionally, you can try, having Chainedit just simply
            call the game, but again I don't know if this works.
            Again in case of a problem, questions, comments (I like
            to receive mail) etc, please do not hesitate to
            write me at Eddie Gaul
                        2917 Via Rivera
                        Palos Verdes, CA  90274.

            If you are local (213) board or are willing to call long
            distance there is a chance of being a BETA board for
            future releases.  Again, this is chosen by closeness
            (locality) and eagerness and success of my games on
            your BBS.

       13)  To register this game or others be sure to check out
            REGISTER.FRM for ordering info.  Special deals and stuff
            on the older stuff.

       14)  Optionally I can be reached on the WWIV Net at all of
            these area code (213) boards:
              Usernumber 19 at Eyes of the World (WWIV NET)
              Onliner Game Net WWIV NET, usually post on it.
              Altered Dimensions. (WWIV NET)
              Circus Maximus (WWIV NET)
              Hz Castle (WWIV NET)
              Castle Kzin (WWIV NET, usernumber 2)

            Again I thoroughly enjoy hearing from you and is usually
            the highlight of a usually lame day.

       15)  Good luck and enjoy.
