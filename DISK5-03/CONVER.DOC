Introduction : Conversation in Pit Fiend's Adventures Volume 3 plays
a crucial part in whether or not you succeed in your quests.  Often
times people inside the cities hold invaluable clues or even magical
words required to enter some of the dungeons.  Here is a general
guideline on how to converse with people that you encounter in cities
or in the great outdoors.

When you are in a city you will be confronted by a list of people that
you can talk to.  Choose the person by entering his number when prompted
as to whom you'd like to talk to.

After you have selected a person you will be confronted with the following:

NAME -->
DESCRIPTION -->

The person's name of whom you are talking to is under the Name part of it
and the description of where the person is, what the person is doing,
and etc are under the description.  Often times you can get valuable
clues or suggestions as to what to discuss with a person by their
description.

Important Note:
  It should be noted that anything in double quotes (") should be inquired
  about (see below).  Often these are key words which are used to extract
  important clues and information from a person.

Next you will have the following line appear:

active name, (1-3), (D)escribe, (G)reet, (I)nquire, (L)eave, (O)ffer ->


Active Name  is the person's name that is currently doing the talking.
You can switch your active player by typing a 1 through 3 to turn on
a new character.

Describe:  This commands reprints the Name and Description of the person
you are talking to.

Greet:  Often before Inquiring with a person, you should Greet them.
By greeting a person you are in short saying, "Hey what's up", or
"Greetings, how are you", etc.  Often the response from a character
is a short greeting back.  If a person replies back with something
in quotes, be sure to ask (inquire) about it!

Inquire:  By inquiring you will be asked to enter a short word
(under 12 characters).  Usually these words are nouns, but sometimes
they can be verbs.  If a key word is longer than 12 letters just
enter as much as you can. Do NOT put quotes around the key word.
Spelling must be correct.

If you inquire about a keyword that the person knows something
about he or she will reply with 1-4 lines of words.  If the person
knows not what you are talking about he or she will return a
standard statement to the effect that he doesn't know anything
about what you are asking about.

Leave:  Say goodbye to the person you are talking to.  You are
then free to select a new person to talk to.  When you leave
the person you are talking to will often times say goodbye
back to you or even sometimes give you a clue.

Offer:  Often times, when you lack enough personality to talk to
someone it may be neccessary to suplicate their pocket books.  By
selecting this option you will be asked an amount of how much gold
you wish to "bribe" the other person.  Once you have bribed him he
will remained bribed until you close conversations with him.  A
standard bribe is usually in the ranges of 25-100 goldpieces.

Charisma and Talking:
  High Officials, criminals, jailors, knights, wizards, many
  "high class" folks are snooty.  They will not talk to one
  unless they have enough personality to talk to them.  If
  you lack enough personality to integrate with these folk
  be sure that you learn how to increase your personality,
  bribe them, or remain ignorant.

Example of Conversation:

Name : Jonas H. McGinty
Description:  Salty Captain of the Sea, long white "beard"
Eddie, (D)escribe, (G)reet, (I)nquire, (L)eave, (O)ffer -> O {offer}
I am sorry, I have no need for your money. {doesn't want my money}
Eddie, (D)escribe, (G)reet, (I)nquire, (L)eave, (O)ffer -> G
hello, just arrive from the Port Hartnak!
Eddie, (D)escribe, (G)reet, (I)nquire, (L)eave, (O)ffer -> I
Inquiry: BEARD {I type this in}
Yes, I have been growing it for a long time.  The women love it!
Eddie, (D)escribe, (G)reet, (I)nquire, (L)eave, (O)ffer ->I
Inquiry: HARTNAK {I type this in}
Yes, much trouble there, they say a legion of Trolls
have been hurting people!  They need a hero.  Also
Angel was seen there!
Eddie, (D)escribe, (G)reet, (I)nquire, (L)eave, (O)ffer -> I
Inquiry: SALTY SEA {I type this in}
I don't have the slightest idea what you are talking about!
Eddie, (D)escribe, (G)reet, (I)nquire, (L)eave, (O)ffer -> L
Have trails, whoops, sails to you... hardy har har.


Of course this converstion could have went further, what would have
happened if I asked about Angel, or Trolls?  Not everything
that must be asked about is in (")'s.
