   Here you can read what exactly happened in Scottsville, at
   the time of Angel's capture.  As told by Rumar, a minstral
   of the vagabond type:


       Tis was joyous day.  The adventurer had just left seeking
   the doom of Pit Fiend.  Having discovered that he could be found
   at Ladera Linda, off the coast of Scottsville, the adventurer boarded
   a ship heading there.  To say the least everybody wasn't expecting
   to see the adventurer return.

       Alas he did, a few days afterward he returned.  He had defeated
   Pit Fiend and some of the Death Angels that surrounded his resting
   place.  Something had changed though, the adventurer seemed more
   aloof, almost as if his body had been warped, twisted, or
   possessed.  He was holding back something.....

       To say the least I was able to procure some of the last of the
   Soma, still some of it flourished.  Being a bard I am able to avoid
   the addiction to the stuff.  I remember playing sweet melodies
   to the king and his court.  The reknown adventurer was a guest of
   honor.

       The wine overflowed from chalices and it seemed that peace was
   to be the reign of order.  Even the Knights lost their strictness and
   in the morning rumors of misbehavior to the wenches were abound.

       Angel, a young girl of the ripe age of 12, was also present at
   festivities.  She was of the most importance to the finale of the
   conquest of Pit Fiend.  She was to close the portal forever, from
   Pit Fiend ever reentering the world in any state.  Guarded by
   dozens of the knights, she was watched over and cared for.  She
   was born on everyone and no one.  She had wandered into the castle
   many years back, I believe 5 or so.  Cut with thorns, bruised,
   and hungry, the knights and the king took her to see the Clerics
   outside of town for help.  Healing and feeding her the clerics
   noticed that she had a star on both of her hands.  Meditating,
   praying, and researching, they found that she was godsent.  She
   was to seal the fate of Pit Fiend in the future if destiny had
   its way.

       Angel, though, is not spoiled.  Having lived a life in the castle
   she still remained innocent and pure.  Very pretty I might add also.
   She will one day make a fine wife to any such honorable man to marry
   her.  She was a sorceroress though.  Trained and destined to be
   one of the most powerful.  She had natural powers, even those beyond
   the much trained wizards of the court.  Her powers were not intended
   to be used for harm, and even if she knew of them she wouldn't have.
   She is a deva of good.

       The week continued and the ceremony was being prepared.  Wizards
   and witches from all over the continent came bearing gifts and much
   needed items to complete the ceremony.  Angel, on the other hand, was
   much confused by the many people.  It was unusual to see so many bards
   and others around the castle.  Guards were lax, as wizards prepared
   spells to guard her door and she was in the top of the castle, in
   between her room and the king's court was the Knights barracks, always
   which is full of the strongest and most honorable knights.

       No one suspected that anyone would so foolish as try to hurt her.
   Evidently, though, they didn't suspect enough.  Some one, some how
   was able to kidnap her, I remember the night very well, here is what
   I know of it.

          Sitting in the corner, basically strumming my lute and
          creating new songs and stories I heard a scream and great
          commotion.  The king was startled out of his sleep and the
          knights ran down to the king's court.  Discovering that
          the action was not there they proceeded upstairs, never
          realizing that it came from the top of the castle.

          They entered the room where Angel was supposed to lie.
          She was not there.  Her guardian and teacher of the ways
          of life, Tabatha, lie asleep on the floor.  The guard,
          on his hands and knees holding his head in clenched
          guantlets lie screaming.  He tried to stand but was
          very dizzy.  He talked and mumbled and I to myself knew
          it was the work of a drug, the one I have used.

          The window to the room that Angel was in, was broken open,
          glass littering the bed and surrounding floor.  A chill
          wind rushed into the room and the silken curtains moved
          as if they were ghosts.  No one spoke.

          One of the knights, I forget which, said, "Angel is missing!".
          And indeed she was.  A search was called out and the knights
          and wizards used every possible means to search for her.
          No secret doors where in the room, no way out except through
          the window.

          In an instant a dead body was discovered below Angel's
          room, roughly 500 yards or so down.  The body appeared
          as if pushed, or perhaps suicide.  It was a servant by
          the name of Lolac.  Angel's body was not found.  She
          is missing and the only clues are the broken window
          and the dead body lying below her room, which so far
          have produced nothing.  Also whoever planned it or helped
          do it, dosed the guard and Tabatha with Soma, the evil
          narcotic of the ancients.

          Even though destiny is never wrong, Angel's destiny
          could be other than to seal Pit Fiend's fate.  Perhaps
          it is wishful thinking, but she does have something to
          do with Pit Fiend's fate.  Time is not on our side
          for rescuing Angel.
