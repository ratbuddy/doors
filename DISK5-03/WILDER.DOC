  you will be prompted with the following screen:

    Your parties location will be displayed in the upper left hand
    corner of the screen in the viewport.  All of their stats
    will then appear in the status screen in the middle of the screen.
    A Description:
      Name:  Your character's names.
      Hps :  Hit Points Maximum / Hit Points Remaining.
      Mps :  Magic Points Maximum / Magic Points Remaining
       AC :  Armor Class
      Food:  Food Remaining, use the Exchange/Trade routine to pass
             food around.
    Status:  A Word as to the condition of your character.  Poisoned
             is also equal to hungry.  Cure Poison will remove
             the effects of Hungryness, but due to the weakness and
             dehydration of a character, a cure Poison is required
             even after the character has been given food.
         X:  Current X Location of the Character, in terms of the map.
         Y:  Current Y Location of the character, in terms of the map.
       ACT:  Current Action the player has used.


!@#  : Changes the Active Player, !=1, @=2, #=3.

Use the Arrow Keys on your numeric keypad (be sure that the numlock
is ON) to direct your party.  Pressing any of the arrow keys
will move you one space in the desired direction.

(A)utomap : View the Automap on screen.  Automaps are always in effect
except in cities.  Once you move off of a map your automap is erased
and forgotten.  Quitting and then returning to the BBS also
erases any Automaps that you may have.

(C)ast:  A Spell casting character can cast a spell.  Make sure
         that it applies.  Consult to Magic.Doc for spell
         details.

(E)ncamp:  Rests the party and heals all wounds.  There is a chance
           that you may be ambushed while you sleep.  You can only
           encamp three times per play.  Also all spells, effects
           of potions, etc are removed.

(F)ast Mode:  Like the City Command, this can significantly increase
              the display speed.  Use it if you are using 1200-2400 baud.

(H)unt:  Low on food?  Try hunting.  This may waste a lot of moves
         and generally increase your hunger but if you have a skilled
         ranger you can usually find some food.  Hunting is always best
         tried when ON a forest, water, or other livable terrain.
         Hunting may only be attempted while outdoors.  Hunting is done
         by the ACTIVE player.

(I)nspect:  Your active player will inspect an object.  Use the
            direction numbers to indicate where you'd like to look.
            So if you are even confused as to what an object is
            supposed to represent use the Inspect command.

(Q)uit and Save:  Quits and Saves the Game.

(S)ave:  This process takes approximately 2 seconds on an Xt.  Saving
         does not stop the effects of potions, poisoning, or other
         condition or spell (as it did in Pf1).

(T)rade Item:  Like the Exchange/Trade command in cities.  Exchange
               armor/weapons/food to other party members.  Members
               must have enough strength to weild a weapon to
               allow a transfer.  Players may also transfer potions.


(U)se Skill/Potion:  This allows party members to drink a potion,
                     or use a skill such as Laying of Hands (if a
                     Knight) or X-Raying.

(V)iew Party:  View the Active Player.

(Z) Char Funct:  This option allows you to quit without saving or
                 destroy your character.  Destroying your character
                 permanently clears your record.

Notes on View Port:

    Most things can be decerned as to what they are to represent.
    Use the Inspect command if you are unclear as to what they
    are to represent.

    In the outdoors a
      'C' represents a City.

      Upside down 'U' represents a dungeon entrance.

      A pyramid represents a hill or mountain (unpassable)

      'I' represents an Inn, Automaps and Safe Resting may be
          purchased here.

      'T' Temple, players may receive healing, curing, and raising
          of the dead here.  Of course it is at a price.  Temples
          also sell potions.

          Temples can usually be found near big cities.

      Other places of interest also abound.  Look for clues with
      discussions with the citizens of the world.  Road signs
      along the paths also indicate points of interest.  Merely
      run into the signs (â) to read what they say.

      Dungeons, basically of interest in their are:

         'D': Door, monsters lurk behind them.  Do note that
              unlike in PF1, you can walk through rooms where
              possibly treasure can be found or another door.
              Once a room has been cleaned of monsters, it
              will never be repopulated.

         'S': Stairs, these are the exits that lead you back outside.

         'W': StairWell, going up, leads to the next level of a dungeon.

         'w': StairWell, going down, leads to lower levels.

         'â': A sign or message scrawled on a wall.  Usually contains
              clues or hints.

         '$': Treasure, touch these at all costs.  Usually they contain
              money, but sometimes they contain food, potions, or even
              magic items.  Treasure is always kept in containers.
              The tighter the container the more likely the owner put
              a trap on it and the more valuable it is.

              It is wise to have a Spell Caster cast Open Chest on it.
              But this requires 60 spell points, an expensive cost.
              Capable thieves or archers can open the chest and avoid
              the trap that is usually contained on it.  This is the
              Pick Option.

              Once a treasure has been found it will be gone and empty
              forever.  Although it might be there later (if you
              reenter a dungeon) it will contain nothing.

              (Designer Note:  If you run into an I/O Error when touching
              a $, try to avoid it, it is a bad data declaration and
              should be fixed in upcoming upgrades etc.)

              Traps usually consist of poison needles or exploding
              fireballs which inflict grevious damage upon the party.


Other Characters: ('!')

                  Other characters can now be found and bothered.
                  Like in PF1 the bickering among users continue.
                  Other Characters can only be found in the
                  great outdoors or in dungeons.

                  Even though you can encounter each other, your
                  quests are SEPERATE.  Just because you found
                  a treasure doesn't mean he can't either.
                  Pf2 doesn't have this feature (due to its
                  insidious and very buggy nature (not to mention
                  complex)).  If your character is deleted or
                  you destroy it, it will remain in the Locxy.Dat
                  file.  But if and when another character bumps
                  into it, it will not I/O error out, but merely
                  eradicate you off the list.

                  When you encounter another player you have the
                  following options:

            (A)ttack    (G)ive Message   (I)gnore:

                  (A)ttack:  You immediately begin combat with
                  the other player's party.  Do note that
                  the experience rewarded and treasure is NOT
                  THAT MUCH.  Treasure is in no way reflected
                  as to what the player has.  If you win
                  a message stating what you did to the other
                  player is sent to him along as returning him
                  to the LAST city he entered. (which can be
                  a real pisser).  So hide yourself well and
                  quit in cities.  If you fail to defeat his
                  party he will still know what you did
                  because a message will be passed stating that
                  you tried to attack.

                  (G)ive Message:  A message is sent back
                  to the other party.  It comes with your
                  name attached to it and is also reported
                  to the SYSOP!

                  (I)gnore:  A message stating that you
                  encountered the opposing party is sent along
                  with stating that you didn't attack him or her.


                  Do note that all of the above actions remove
                  the "encountered" party off of the Locxy.Dat file
                  so that they cannot be discovered again until
                  they play again.  It should be noted that I do
                  NOT encourage the use of attacking other parties
                  nor forming alliances.  The job of the player
                  is to rescue Angel, not beat up on others.  Possible
                  law enforcement each time you attack is probable
                  (for murder hehe).


Magic Mouths and Wandering Encounters:

           Occasionally along the roads you will encounter farmers,
           merchants, or other folk on various endevours.  Or
           you can possibly run into a band of nasty monsters.
           Also a weird and interesting device known only as a Magic
           Mouth will sometimes come up.  This is sort of an
           "automessage" which contains a brief sentence from a player.

           All Magic Mouths statements are reported to the sysop.
           You can change the statement whenever it appears.
           Due to the random nature of it, you may encounter it
           several times before another player has had a chance to
           change it.

           Attention SYSOPS:  Run CMMOUTH.EXE to reset the magic
           mouth if you find it not to your liking.  It runs
           a default sentence through it.  Do NOT erase the MOUTH.DAT
           file!

Hint:  It is wise to purchase automaps at inns so as to locate
dungeons and stuff like that without having to search the entire
area.  Also keep and eye out for signs and other terrain landmarks.
