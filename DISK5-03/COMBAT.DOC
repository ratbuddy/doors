      Combat is a crucial part of Pit Fiend's Adventure Volume 3.
      Many things have changed since the inception of the series.
      Below are the rules for the new combat methodology:

      (1-4):  Attack Monster Set 1-4.

      This command will attack a monster set, if the set is non-existant
      or all the monsters are dead you will be given the opportunity
      to reselect a group.

      The character that you use to attack the monsters will first
      try to get monsters in melee.  If there are no monsters in
      melee combat he or she will use their missile weapon.  If they
      do not have the appropriate weapon, they will have a chance
      to reselect.

      Note that a character cannot fire a missile weapon at a group
      if ANY of the group's members are in melee.

      Chances of hitting are based on Battle Integrity, Strength
      (for melee purposes), Coordination (for Missile), Level,
      and the monster's defenses.

 CAST OPTION

      By selecting the C option, if your character is a spell
      caster he/she may opt to cast a spell.  See Magic.Doc
      for details on spell effects.  Some spells cannot be
      cast during combat.

 EQUIPVIEW OPTION

      By selection this option, the active player will the
      oppurtunity to view his equipment, such as weapons, armors,
      and potions.  This does not take up your turn in combat.

 FIRE RING OPTION

      By selecting this option, the person whose turn it currently
      is can use a magical combat ring.  Rings effect only 1 group
      of monsters and have a specific amount of charges attached
      to them.  Once all used the ring becomes useless.


 MISSILE/MELEE OPTION

      This option is very important and parties that use it wisely
      can most easily defeat a slow group of monsters!  When
      choosing this option you will be presented by a:
         1.  Missile    2. Melee
      By selecting one of the above, you have the chance to
      move one GROUP of monsters to the desired location.  Dependent
      upon your speed and the monsters speed, the monsters will
      move to the location of your choice.

  PASS
      This option bypasses a party member's turn.  They do nothing
      in that round except for take a defensive stature.  Use this
      option when all the monsters have died and you have remaining
      party members still alive.

  RETREAT
      At the end of your turn your party will end combat and flee
      the scene.  Of course, if the monsters have yet to have their
      turn in combat, they will be allowed to attack.

  USE POTION
      The only potions that may be used in combat are the Healing
      and Magic Restoration Potions.  View the Potion.Doc for
      details on potions.

  Z -- Abort Combat
      This cheater's key has been incorporated as your Ctrl-Alt-Del
      key (Reset).  Although it doesn't reset the BBS, it does
      return you back to the BBS WITHOUT saving your character.
      This is also a safety net against bugs.

Notes on Monsters:

      Monsters generally attack the most powerful member of your
      party.  The general strategy for most monsters is to cast
      spells, shoot missiles, and then close to do melee.  They never
      retreat.

      Some monsters also have the ability to cast Delayed Fireballs,
      which are sort of a deadly new spell.  Occasionally, you may
      see the statement, "XXXXX casts a Delayed Fireball, comencing now!"
      At this point the large flame begins to get larger and stronger.
      Each turn in combat it will do more damage.  At the end of combat
      and all the monsters have died, the spell will release and wreak
      havoc upon the party.  Retreating will avoid the spell, but does
      not clear the encounter (of course).  It is wise to act quickly
      when a fireball has been released!

Notes on Screen:

      When you encounter a group of monsters you will be brought up
      against 1 to 4 sets of monsters.  Each of the sets can contain
      up to 10 monsters (but no more than 10).  Below is an example
      of what you may find:

               MELEE                    MISSILE

   1.      (3) Kobolds                 (0) Kobolds
   2.      (0) Kobold Chieftain        (1) Kobold Chieftain

      Basically this means that groups 3 and 4 are NON-EXISTANT.  While
      group 1 contains 3 Kobolds in Melee and 0 Kobolds in Missile.
      Group 2 contains 0 Kobold Chieftains and 1 Kobold Chieftain in
      Missile Combat.  Do note that even if you have slain all of the
      monsters in a group, they will remain on the screen, but with
      quantities of 0 in both the Melee and Missile option.
