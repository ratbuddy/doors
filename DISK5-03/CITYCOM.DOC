(1-3) Change Active Player:  This will change the active player.  By
  selection the appropriate number you can choose a player to be
  in charge of the party and all of its actions.  Only a person
  who not dead can be active.

(B)oating:  If a town is a port you can see where it sails.  You will
be given a listing of where the town captain travels to.  Depending upon
the length of the trip, a variable amount of moves will be added
to you total moves.  Boating is the ONLY way to travel across long
distances of water.

(C)onverse with Townfolk -- This enables you to get to the townfolk
  (see CONVER.DOC) for details.

(D)rink Potion -- You can drink a potion here.  See Potion.doc for
  potion details.

(E)xchange/Trade -- Change items between players.  Items that
can be traded or exchanges are any weapon, armor, potions, and food.

(F)ast Mode -- Fast Mode, allows you to significantly speed up the
outdoor movement scrolling.  When you choose for fast mode, the color
for outdoor scrolling will be gone, it will appear in black and white.
Not viewing the Wilderness/Dungeon Helpframe is the one with the boxes
and available commands.  Be sure to hit '?' or reselect 'F'ast Mode
to return the Boxes and available commands.

(G)eneral Store -- enter the general store, see General.Doc

(L)eave Town! -- Be sure that you have weapons because there are evil
ones out there.  Most of the action in the game takes place outside.
You can reenter the city of course from outside.

(M)agic Spell, Cast -- Cast a Magic Spell.  See Magic.Doc for
spell details.

(Q)uit and Save -- Allows you to Quit and Save your party.  You will be
returned back to the BBS.  Good and bad spells affects are removed
when quitting.  Although poisoning and dead conditions are not.

(S)ave Character -- Quite wise to do this often.  Saves your character,
spell effects are not turned off by saving.

(U)tilities, Character -- This is a place where you can exchange characters
for new ones.  Consult NewChar.Doc for details.

(V)iew Party : Views the active player in all of his glory.

(Y)our Guardian Angel:  A brief one page description and hints on what
the creators of the game (namely myself) intended you to do at this point
of the game.  It is all true.  Since there isn't a map to the game
we opted to use this way to inform people generally who was important
and where to go.  This should be the first and last thing you do
in each city that you enter.

(Z) -- Destroy Party :  This has several options:
    (Q)uit without Saving:  Abort back the BBS with no save.

    (D)estroy party.  When you destroy your party it will erase
    the save file and remove you from the game.  If you do not like
    the game it is wise that you save the sysop some Hard drive
    space and destroy your party.
