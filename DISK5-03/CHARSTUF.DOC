                       Character Information


This small portion of the documentation covers the vitals of a character
such as what each of the stats portrays and what is considered good.
Also a description of all of the classes and their special abilities
are noted:

Statistics:  All of the statistics are prerolled in PF3.  The choice
is yours when selecting characters.  If you are wise you will look
at the Personalities of each character.  This gives a hint at what
there skills are before you begin the complex issues of who is good
for your party and taste.  You may prefer a magic orientated party
or perhaps a hack and slash party, perhaps no thieves at all?
View and and select carefully from the character pool.  There are NO
perfect parties nor any guarentees that any one character is better
than another.

Do note that none of the characters that are in the pool have
ANY Possessions, just clothing, hands as a weapon, and no missile weapon.
They are healed and healthy though.

RETURNING A CHARACTER:

   When you return a character to the pool you are in effect throwing
   them away.  They do NOT retain their experience, nor items (the
   disk space this would be incredible if it were roughly 10K to a
   user!).  You may not return a dead character nor a poisoned one.
   They must be healthy (although not full hit points).

   Therefore select wisely before running off to do battle.

You must leave the pooling area with three characters before you will
be allowed to play again.

Statistics:  Stats are usually ranged from 1-100, although with
magical help you may attain very high levels.  Character Editors
in registered versions allow very high stats (but only cheaters use
those).  Anyhow, any stat over 19 generally give benefits.  Any stat
less 7 then causes detractions.  Those in between do not necessarily
give any immediate benefit but to count in critical situations.

   STR :  Strength, determines how strong a player is.  A strong
          player will hit more, do more damage, and have benefits
          involving the use of brawn.

   INT :  Intellect, the ability to act intelligently.  Helps
          determine "queer" or out of the ordinary events.  Also
          effects how many spell points a spell caster gets
          at time of advance.

   WIS :  Wisdom, determines how wise a player is.  Is usuaully
          used along with intelligence in special situations.

   DEX (or CRD) : Coordination:  Determines armor class and other
          skills such as lock picking etc involving manual coordination.

   HTH :  Health.  Modifies the amount of hit points gained at level
          advancement.

   PER :  Personality.  Allows better prices at shops as well as
          talking with people.  Important to develop.  A score of
          50 or more allows discussion with most people.

   LCK :  Modifies saving throws, which is Luck.  How favorable
          the gods are etc.

   HPS :  Hit points, points that determine how much damage you can
          sustain before dying.  When you reach less than 1 you
          are considered dead.  Hit points can never exceed
          your maximum.  Use healing spells to restore lost
          hit points.  New maximum hit points are determined
          at a new level.

   MPS :  How many magic spells (magic points) a cast can cast
          based on their Health and Skill.  Magic Points can be
          regained by resting or potions.  New Maximum spell
          points can be gained by help of others.... you must
          discover this.

    AC :  Armor Class, how much protection a character has based
          upon armor type and coordination.  The higher the
          armor class the harder it is to hit a character.

   #AT :  Number of Attacks per round a player is allowed in comat,
          exclusive of the number of times a weapon is allowed to attack.

Classes:

  Barbarian:  These hearty folk love battle.  They dislike magic
              but will tolerate it.  Prefering axes, they often
              charge into battle with a frenzy, enabling them
              one additional attack rather than the standard
              one at lower levels.

  Thief:      Thieves are great at back stabbing.  Upon any hit
              to a monster, they can do double damage.  This
              chance is based upon their level.  They can
              also pick traps more easily off of traps than
              any other character.  Also based upon their level
              they have the ability to "X-ray" a door and discover
              what monsters may lurk inside.  Thieves do not
              steal from their own party.

  Fighter:    The best at fighting and in getting hit points at
              each level.  They are standard stock but not to be
              treated lightly.  Unlike the other fighter stock
              they gain levels more quickly.

  Knights:    Knights have good fighting skills, can cast spells
              minimally, and can lay hands restoring 2 hit points
              per level of the knight upon a wounded character,
              outside of combat.  This can only be used once per
              day (until a party rests, quits etc).  Knights
              gain levels very slowly.

  Sorceror/ess:  Wizard and Witches who use their magic to manipulate
                 and hurt others.  Very wise to contain ATLEAST one
                 of these.  Gain levels slowly and are not good in
                 combat without some spells.

  Archer:     Has some skills like that of a Thief, but are
              restricted.  They are very deadly with a bow
              and hit often with it.  They gain levels fairly
              quickly, but not as quick as a regular thief would.
              They do NOT have the X-ray ability as that of a thief
              would.  This character is a good addition to any
              combat deficient party.

  Ranger:     Fighter type of the woods.  They are very good at hunting,
              have minimal spell capabilities, and have LESS chance of
              running into a wandering monster with one as the ACTIVE
              player.  They gain levels slowly like that of a knight
              or barbarian but make up for it in combat, where they
              are fairly good.  A good addition to any party.
