A Notice to Pit Fiend's Adventures Volume I players (unregistered)
   It has come to my attention that Pf versions 1.00, 1.01, 1.02
   will cause UNPREDICTABLE combat results after a player gets
   more than one attack per round.  Not to mention that PF1
   also leaves 'open' files on your hard drive.  There are several
   ways to fix this:

      1)  Register PF2 or PF3, or send $5.00 to me, a check made out
          for the Community Helpline should be sent to me, whereupon
          I will send them the check.

      2)  Run CHKDSK /F to remove lost clusters on your hard drive.
          These usually wind up to be 1000 bytes of "garbage" on your
          hard drive.  Merely erase them and all *.MSG files once
          in a while.

      3)  Tell your players to finish the game before achieving the
          fifth level to avoid getting more than one attack.

     Pf1 registered also fixes many bugs (run/time) and has an
     nifty little automapper, faster scrollilng etc.  Although,
     there is NO guarentee that it is bug free, the Closing of files
     is fixed and so is the combat problem.  It also uses PF2's
     combat system (nearly 100% bug free) and has a FAST SCROLL and
     reprint option.

In advance, I'd like to thank Brian (Xev.), Heidi, Pete, Steve (Woody),
and Melanie for the crazy stuff that happens after dark.  As well
as to all the boards that supported and registered the PF series.

To those that labored in testing:  Excuse the missspellings:
   Raelini -- sysop of the Eyes of the World and thanks for the bug finds
   Tanis   -- Good work on being the first to win, as well as the first
              to find a way to cheat....
   Dragonmaster -- Once again, you got pretty far... Good work!
   Knight  Errant -- Thanks for the testing... well done!
   Iron Horse --  Sysop of Hz Castle -- thanks for the testing site and
                  patience to keep track of all the new versions!
   Turtle, Mystic, and the many others out there who helped test this
   puppy.
   Of course, I'd like to thank Hz Castle BBS and Eyes of the World BBS
   to be the Beta site for this game.  Its a huge game, compounded by
   three or so NEW versions every week, well it kinda adds up.  Luckily
   (kjashdf as lkjdhf (knock on keyboards)) nothing serious happened,
   atleast I haven't heard yet...

So after some 15,000 lines of code ALONE for this game (probably
a total of 25,000 lines or so for PF2 and PF1 combined) it all comes
to an end.  It was tough finishing this game and finally, I have gotten
somethig, well, how shall I say, I really like.  I don't touch my
own games, and rarely myself play anyone elses.

So what is an old demon like myself gonna do?  Heck, I don't know,
PF4?  I can say quite honestly right now, hell no, but that's what
I said after PF2.... I might be starting something new, more competive
type of game or perhaps move on to graphics programming.  But whatever,
it all doesn't really matter that much anyways.  I'll find something
interesting to do.

Anyways, after 1 year 50,000 lines of code 20-30 360K disks, I wind
up the series on #3.  Once again, I'd like to thank all the people
who helped me out in the early days of PF1 (Jim, Ali, Mike and a ton
of other people) and all the boards that every participated in the
making of these adventures.

Good luck!  You'll need it!
