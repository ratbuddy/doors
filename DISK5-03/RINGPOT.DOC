                                    Potions

    There are ten different kinds of Potions:

    Healing and Spell Point Restoration:  These potions can be used at any
    time allowing you to restore lost hit points or spell points.  Amount
    restored depends upon your level.

    Potions of Luck, Strength, Dexterity,Personality modify
    your stats until you quit your game.  Also after resting the benefits
    are lost.  Amount gained varies.  A stat of 20 or higher is
    considered good and special benefits are gained.

    Potion of Speed:  This potion allows you an additional attack per
    combat round.  Multiple uses can increase your number of attacks to
    255 if you have 255 potions.

    Potion of Battle Integrity:  Potion that increases your
    hitting skill and defenses and saving throws in combat by one.
    It can be used multiple times, but the effects are lost after
    combat has been finished.

                                     Rings

    Goodie Magic Items!  There are some 19 rings in the game.  A brief
    description follows:

    Rings of Protection:  There are five of these things, varying power!
    For each magical plus you granted one better armor class rating.  It
    also modifies your saving throws against spells and traps!

    Rings of Shocking, Ice Chill, Sharp Pains, and Skull Crusher are all
    offensive rings in that they do damage in combat.  ANY class can use
    these.  They are limited to 10 charges and once all used they are
    worthless.  They are 100% successful.

    Rings of Regeneration:  There are two of these, the standard one heals
    you 1 hit point if you are wounded in outdoor mode.  Every square you
    move into it will restore you 1 hit point.  During combat every three
    rounds it will heal you 1 hit point.  This NEVER runs out.

    Rings of Regeneration #2, this one serves as a Food Source as well as
    a healer.  The charges represent how many foods it is worth.  Handy
    for getting beyond the 99 food limit.  When it runs out of charges it
    becomes a normal Ring of Regeneration.

    Ring of X-Ray Vision:  This rings will allow you to peep through a
    door to see what monsters lurk inside.

    Feather Falling:  The cheapest of the rings, this helps you avoid all
    falling traps such as pits.

    Water Walking:  Longest this thing has charges you are exempt from the
    25 point movement cost of walking in water.  Once out of charges it
    becomes worthless.  Its use is automatic.  It is NOT used in dungeons
    though, onyl outdoors.

    Wall Remover:  This will remove a section of wall in a dungeon.  It
    will make it a blank space.  This is dangerous to use with 1 charge,
    since you may get locked out.  If and when you quit or exit off the
    current map the "eradicated" wall returns back to normal!  So in other
    words, whenever you see "Loading/Dencrypting....." you know that the
    wall that was removed is now replaced!  Also be careful that you don't
    exit off a map unto a non-existant map.  No means of protection have
    been installed into the game.  If you do walk off the map you will be
    dropped back to the BBS without saving your character with an I/O
    error!  You are warned.

    Wall Remover 2 has more charges than Wall Remover #1.

    Teleportation:  This is also a VERY dangerous ring.  Its intended use
    is for you to use it to get from one side of a map to another.  For
    instance, if you know the x,y location of the city in the northern
    part of a map and you are on the southern, far far away, cast it and
    you will be there.

    By using this ring you could tecnically travel all around the world
    quite easily, but you may never get back on to the continent.  Walking
    off an undefined dungeon map or wilderness map will dump you back to
    the BBS with an I/O error, with NO save.  Be careful with this ring!
    You are WARNED!!!

    Ground Level:  This handy ring will return you back to the outdoor
    portion of the game from ANY dungeon!  So if you are 6 levels up or
    down and not wish to walk back through it, use it!  Once used it
    becomes worthless.  A great Time saver!

    Magic Resistance, will absorb 255 points of damage before becoming
    useless.  It will only absorb most magic spells, but not all of them.
    It will generally protect against fireballs (but not delayed)
    but not against curses.

Magic Weapons:
    Many weapons that can be found or bought contain magical bonuses
    (+'s) which allow you to do more damage and get additional attacks.
    The more the pluses the more magical it is.  Be warned, some magic
    items are cursed and can't be gotten rid of unless sold to an
    unsuspecting general store owner.  (which could be a long walk!)
    To many magical minuses could prevent a character from attacking
    at all (in melee or missile!).
