                               AKA Pit Fiend

  In the days following the rescue of Angel in Pit Fiend's Adventure
  Volume III peace flourished through the lands of Californica.
  Pit Fiend was defeated, the knights could let their guard sag
  and people were once again free to roam the lands in search
  of tranquility and peace.

  There was no more Soma; therefore no more crimes.  The monsters
  were hidden or dormat, no longer on the rampage.  It was
  a peaceful time....atleast for the time being.

  And the sudden death of King Scott shocked the world.  Awaken
  out of the peaceful dream like state, people began to panic.
  It was slowly at first, but it picked up.  Rumors spread
  of Soma (Soma is an evil drug) being found and that angry
  dwarves were spreading throughout the land.  Even the normally
  distant elves began to rumble and think somewhat hotly at
  the dwarves.  Meanwhile the humans, normally the leaders
  of the world, were troubled greatly, as King Scott died without
  an heir.......

  And so it passed, the humans bringing forth their hero's who
  had saved Angel from a demon.  While the Elves claimed the right
  to the throne, for they remembered when they had helped the adventure's
  of long ago throw Pit Fiend from the material world.  And the dwarves,
  they just wanted power.  Each had a right and the weak human
  congress could do little to prevent war.

  And so it resulted that the three forces met near China Lake
  quite near the tumbling remains of Cassandra's Complex lies.
  And there they did battle, to become king for all the glory!
