      When you first start Pit Fiend IV you will be prompted
      by a something that looks like this:

           Welcome to PF IV, Pit Fiend!

           Choice:

       You pick you selection by hitting the correct letter.

         Documentation:  You can get help by reading this.
         You will be given a choice of the various instructions
         files and their importance to the game.

         Listings of People:  This little feature will pick
         out everybody that has ever logged into the game and
         show their win/loss ratio.

         Quit:  Returns you back to the BBS.

         Play:  If there are FOUR (4) people in a game you will be
         allowed to play.  If you have been killed you still cannot
         join another game until it is finished.  Once the game
         is finished you are free to choose a new game.
         A game can only be played if and only if there are four
         people in it.

         Remove Self:  If you have Signed up for a game and there
         are not FOUR players in it, you can remove yourself from it.
         If there are four players in it and the game has not yet
         begun you cannot remove yourself.

         Sign Up for a Game:  If there are NOT FOUR (4) people in a game
         you can add yourself into the game.  When there are four people
         in it the game will comence.  If you are the fourth person, you
         will get the first turn.  When you sign up for a game you will
         be asked what race you want to be in the game.  This is
         absolutely crucial to your survival so read carefully:

             Dwarfs:  Dwarfs are sturdy little creatures.  They
             start off with the most Footmen (see Play.Doc) and
             the most Knights of any force.  They receive less
             wizards and archers.  They receive up to FOUR cards
             per turn with the following options (see Play.Doc):
             A dwarf winning a game receives TWO points for winning.
             Dwarves are immune to the Earthquake spell.
                1:  They can discard ALL of their cards if
                    they do NOT play ANY action during their
                    turn.

             Humans:  Humans are fairly strong people.  Their forces
             come out relatively balanced.  They are usually the BEST
             option to take for new players.  They receive up to
             FIVE cards per turn and have the option of discarding
             ONE no matter what at the end of their turn.

             Elves:  Elves receive a heavy bonus in the archery and
             wizard departments.  They have the biggest amount
             of cards, but have extremely poor chance of survival
             in close combat.  They receive up to SIX cards per turn
             and have the option to discard TWO and only two if they
             don't play an ACTION that turn.  Elves are powerful
             but should be used only by a skillful player.

         View People in a Game:  This option allows you to see
         who is playing a game.  So basically it is wise
         to hit S to sign up for a game and then abort out of
         the signing up process and look to see who is playing
         it.  (The reason why I did this should be apparent in
         a registered version.....).  It will show the people's
         names who are playing it.

  Object of the Game:
    The object of the game is to do ONE of the following two things:
       a) Kill everybody in the game
       b) or Reach Range 5 (see Play.Doc)

  You can only play a game ONCE per day.  Technically, you can play
  twice in twenty-four hours though, that is you can play at 6:00pm
  on a Monday and 6:00am on Tuesday.  Once you enter a game by hitting
  P, your time is updated, so if you get disconnected or quit by
  accident, then you must wait till the next day to play again.
  (This prevents players from hanging up on a game if things don't
  go their way).
