                            By Eddie Gaul

                            Aka Pit Fiend


     Most of you are probably confused as heck as to what a "range"
     is or what I mean by a Footmen or Archer.  Or even what an Action
     is.  DO NOT WORRY, IT WILL BECOME CLEAR, READ ON!

     First Off I think I should draw a rough picture of what you will
     see of the screen:

The Very first thing I should say is What an Action is?
  An action is ANYTHING that a group does.  At the start of each
  turn each player's group's actions are cleared.  Each group
  (i.e. Archers, Footment, Wizards etc) may perform on ACT, such
  as moving, firing, jumping in terrain, etc.  Using such cards
  as Earthquake and Forest Fire count as actions against wizards
  and footmen respectively.  A group CANNOT play more than one
  action per turn.  When a group plays an action a red flashing
  * will appear next to the group letter.  If none is there
  they have yet to play an action.

(Top of Screen): Cards in Hand will be drawn here.

 This is a sample of what MAY happen in the late stages of the game.
 Some discussion is Necessary  Naturally it shows the names of the
 people (thanks to many of those folks who let me "borrow" their names)
 and the race that they have chosen to be.

 Your first notice will be what the heck is Archers, Footmen, Wizards,
 Knights, Dragons....
   Archers:  These guys are the range shooters.  They are pretty decent
   at ranges 2-3.  Any closer or further away they loose their
   effectiveness.  At close range they are worthless as attackers.

   Footmen:  These are the backbone of the army.  The cannon fodder.
   Footmen are usually the ones to get close in and do the dirty work
   of disposing of the enemy at close range.

   Wizards:  These people are like archers.  They are best at ranges
   2-4 and can cast a variety of spells, dependent upon the cards.
   Such spells as Earthquake and Smoke are very helpful in making
   an enemy fall to their knees.

   Knights:  These are like the Footmen except they are stronger
   and harder to kill.

   Dragons:  The most powerful piece of fighting machine.  Deadly
   at close range, and even worst of all, deadly in quantity.  A player
   possessing a pair of these monsters should be stopped before they
   burn an opponent to a crisp!

                    ________________________________


   The Q stands for Quantity.  A number will be placed below it
   indicating how many of that particular unit they have.  For instance
   Lukas has 6 Archers.

   The T stands for Terrain.  A lengthy description follows:

        Depending upon what terrian you are in, the better (or worse)
        chances you have of staving off an attack.  A players
        terrain will be flashing RED if they are moving.  A moving
        army is a much easier kill.  So kill somebody you see moving.

        Clear Terrain:  Offers NO protection.  Is represented by a '='.
        Woods        :  Offers good protection (-20%) and is represented
                        by a  (alt - 157).  Can be hit by a Tree Burn
                        action.
        Brush        :  Offers decent protection (-10%) and is
                        represented by a B
        Hills        :  Represented by a ï (alt - 239).  This offers
                        minus 10% to defense and adds 10% if you are
                        attcking FROM it!
        Towers       :  Represented by a T.  This offers -30% but
                        is susceptible to an earthquake spell.
        Castles      :  Represented by a C.  This offers -40% but
                        is susceptible to an earthquake spell.
        Swamps       :  Causes the player to suffer with a -10% on
                        attacks as well as defense.  It takes a
                        movement action to get out with no range
                        increment and there is a 50% failure of
                        getting out and the action wasted.  This is
                        represented by a Twisting sideways 8.  You may
                        play a swamp against another play.  Do note,
                        that it is NOT an action to play one on
                        an opponent!


    S column is for Smoke.  If a player is afflicted with smoke his
    column will show an S.  Smoke has the same defensive properties
    as a swamp does but is easy to get out of.  Merely by moving
    (in any direction) and then placing terrain will get rid
    of smoke.

    R Range....  Each player starts out at range 0.  One of the
    objectives to the game is to reach range 5.  A player plays
    movement cards in order to move backwards or forwards or sideways.
    Sideways means just moving from side to side and not into another
    army.  Basically used to switch terrains without advancing.
    No player can get past range 5 or below 0.

    Player's distances can be computed by ADDING the ranges.  Therefore
    Pit Fiend's Archer at Range 0 and a Footmen of Lukas's team at range
    0 are at range 0.  Where if I was at range 3 and his was at 1
    we'd be at RANGE 4.  Do note that a player cannot exceed 5.  Meaning
    that let's say Lukas's Dragon is at Range 3 and my archer is at
    range 2.  We therefore are at range 5.  I CANNOT move my archer
    to range 3 (3+3 > 5) without first KILLING all of Lukas's Dragons.
    If and when I do this, his 0 dragons will be set back to zero.
    A similar situation is above where Raelini's Archers are at
    Range 4 where Lukas's archers at 1.  Raelini cannot move forward
    to win the game until she defeats Lukas's archers or Lukas moves
    his archers back.

The Cards:
   Here are some of the various cards in the game and their abbreviation.
   A detailed description follows each so read on carefully:

    Quantity   Abbreviation   Description
       8           WODS         Play a Wood Terrain Card on
                                ANY moving group!
      12           BUSH         Play a Bush Terrain Card on
                                Any moving Group!
       9           HILS         Play a Hill Terrain Card on
                                Any moving Group!
       7           TOWR         Play a Tower Terrain Card on
                                Any moving Group!
       5           CASL         Play a Castle Terrain Card on
                                Any moving Group!
       9           SWAM         Play a Swamp terrain Card on
                                an opponent or your Group!  Must
                                be moving.
      Placing Terrain:
      A group that is eligible to receive terrain must:
        1) NOT have played an action that turn
        2) Must be moving, a stationary group cannot receive terrain.

      31           MOVE         This card allows you to move:
      Forwards/Backwards/or Sideways.  See movement rules for above.
      A group may not move past range 5 or below range 0.  Sideways
      will enable you to change terrain without modifying your range.
      A group that plays a movement card uses their action for their
      turn.  Meaning that you cannot play a movement and a terrain
      card on the same team in the same turn!  You may only run
      TWICE before you MUST play a terrain card.  Meaning you cannot
      rush to range 5 with 5 movement cards.  A moving group fires
      at half strength and defends poorly (by 10% for each movement card).
      A flashing RED terrain indicator means that group is moving.


      55           FIXX          Fire Card.  See Fire Rules.
                                 The XX stands for the neccessary
                                 fire strength neccessary to fire
                                 a card.  Therefore a FI18 means
                                 that a group must have 18 strength
                                 points to fire.
      10           RFAR          Reinforces Archers from 1 to 6.
                                 Constitutes the Archer's Actions
                                 for that turn.
      10           RFFT          Reinforces the Footmen by 1 to 6.
       6           RFWZ          Reinforces the Wizards by 1 to 3.
       4           RFKT          Reinforces the Knights by 1 to 3.
       2           RFDG          Reinforces the Dragons by 1 to 2.
       6           SMKE          Causes Smoke to be placed on
                                 anybody.  Smoke can only be removed
                                 by moving out of the that range
                                 (or my moving Sideways).  The Smoke
                                 effects are taken off when a new
                                 terrian is placed on the affected group.
                                 Smoke hinders firing into by 10%
                                 and out of by 10%.  So it is both
                                 good and bad.  Requires atleast
                                 ONE wizard to use and constitutes
                                 the Wizard's Actions.
        2          ERQK          Causes the following things to happen
                                 if the player has atleast 5 wizards.
                                   A) if the affected player that has
                                      any groups in a Castle, that
                                      Castle is reduced to a Tower.
                                   B) If the affected player had any
                                      groups in a Tower, that Tower
                                      is reduced to a Hill.
                                   C) Dragons in Castles/Towers
                                      are NOT affected in any manner.
                                   D) Each Footmen has a 75%
                                      Each Archer has a 75%
                                      Each Wizard has a 65%
                                      Each Knight has a 55%
                                      of dying.
                                   E) The player who casts an Earthquake
                                      has used their Wizard's Actions
                                      for that turn!
           3      FIRE             This requires 12 or more Footmen.
                                   Tree burn is exactly like a
                                   Earthquake (in terms of percentages)
                                   except dragon's percentage is 15%.
                                   Any group in a Forest will loose
                                   their Forest Terrain and have it
                                   turn into Clear Terrain, movement
                                   will stop if applicable.
                                   This counts as the Footmen's
                                   action for that turn.
           1      HERO             For each of your Knights you have
                                   a 10% chance of killing an opponents
                                   Dragons.  Terrain and any other
                                   modifications do NOT apply.
                                   Counts as a Knight's action for that
                                   turn!


  Choices

  You will be presented with some options:
    Choice:  (CDEFPR):
      C = Clear Terrain, you may use ANY card you want to
          stop the movement of a group.  This is an easy
          way to get rid of extra cards, but also consider you are
          not getting any defensive protection!  Constitutes
          as an action for the group that receives the clear
          terrain.
      D = Depenpendant upon race.  An action is termed as an act.
          Each group may perform one act.  If your race provides
          that you NOT play an action to discard, that means that
          you cannot play a single card on any group!  See
            Humans can discard one card no matter how many actions
            they play.
            Elves can discard TWO cards if they play NO actions.
            Dwarves can discard up to all FOUR cards if they play
            no Actions in their turn.
          Once you discard that is THE END of your turn!
      E = End your Turn and come back to the BBS
      F = Use Fire Card.  See Fire Rules
      P = Play any other card than a fire card.
      R = Reports, each time a player does something in the game
          it goes into a file MESS+Character of the Game+.SAV.
          When you hit R you will be presented with the following opts:
             (M)essage Send Put your own Global threat or hate message.
             Keep it clean.  You are allowed to send two (2) per play
             and constitute NO ACTION.
             (Q)uit, go back to the game.
             (R)ead All.  Will print all the Messages in the game.
             (S)can.  Allows you to read a portion of the messages.
          The game keeps only 50 of them.  So keep up with them.
          They are generally short.  Therefore the first thing
          you should do is read the messages BEFORE doing anything
          to see if anybody has attacked you.
      ? = Shows you the choices in their full names.


Fire Rules:

      Here is a table showing you some facts about the various
      strengths of the various groups.  This table is considered
      to assume a group of ONE.  Meaning 1 Archer, 1 Footman etc.
    Range  0        1       2       3      4      5     Defense Modification

Archer     1       1.5      2       2      1     0.5      0
Footman   0.5      1        1.25    1.75   2.25   3       8
Wizard     1       2        3       3      1     0.5      16
Knight    0.75     1        2       3      4      5       32
Dragon     5       6        7       8      9     10       48

What does this all mean?  Well it means that if I have 12 Archers
at Range 2 then I can use 24 point in fire power.  Each fire card
has a number on it.  You can use any combination of fire power cards
up to your maximum to fire.  When you hit 'F' you will be prompted with
the following:

  A-F,0 to fire,?:

  By hitting ? you will be asked to find what group you are intending
  to use to fire with.  It will ask you who your target is.  It will
  then compute the maximum firepower that you can muster, it is
  recommended that you do this always to select the best possible
  combination of fire cards.

  By hitting A-F you can select cards.  A number in command line
  will tell you how many points you have selected.  Hit 0 to commence
  the firing.  If you over select firepower it will tell you and
  cancel firing.  If you decide not fire hit 0, it will not charge an
  action and cancel firing.  Remember you can use as many fire cards,
  as you want, so long as you have the group strength to back them up.

  Your fire strength is then multiplied by 10, resulting in a
  percentage.

  The Defense modification is how hard it is too kill someone.
  Meaning a Footmen is easier to kill than a Dragon.  This is inherent.
  It is added in with ANY terrain bonuses you may be receiving.  This
  modification is multiplied by 8, plus an bonuses from terrain, smoke,
  etc to result in a percentage which is subtracted from the attacker's
  percentage.

  Percentages of 0 or less have a 1% chance of killing and percentages
  greater than 99 are 99% effective.

  Once the percentage is computed it then determines how many are killed.
  You will be asked if you like the chances and you may abort the fire
  mission if you do not like the odds without loss of action or cards.
  The results of combat are random, not guarenteed.  So if you have a
  75% of killed each of 4 Knights and only kill 1..... well then that's
  how the cookie crumbles.

  If you kill an entire group their terrain is removed and they are
  sent back to zero range.  Of course, they may get reinforcements later
  and continue along the merry route of winning, but that is hard to
  come by.  You get no extra points for eliminating a person.  When a
  person is Completely eliminated they are not allowed back into the
  game, therefore their army will never regenerate.

  When you call back next day, you will have new cards, depending
  upon what was played and discarded.  There are 184 cards, watch
  for the reportlog to say when it was reshuffled.

  Strategies:
     1)  Use smoke when you want to reduce an opponents archer's
         strength.  Or use them on yourself when you are going
         to be on the "move".

     2)  Use those swamps on an advancing army.  Use them especially
         when you are running low on men and are trying to stave
         off an advancing opponent.

     3)  Remember your race.  Dwarves, don't hestitate to spend
         turns to discard all your cards.  Elves, use those cards,
         and humans discard when you can.  Humans have an advantage
         in the discard department but are the weakest initially.

     4)  Watchout for the elves at the beginning, their archers must
         be stopped.

     5)  Be EXTREMELY fearful of ANYONE no matter what range they
         are at with more than ONE DRAGON.  Three of 'em killed
         practically everyone once.  If you get a Reinforce Dragon
         use it!

     6)  Use the Send Message Commands to work people.  Pick on
         one opponent to get him out of there.  The game becomes
         very long if everybody chips away at everybody else.

     7)  Don't forget you can run SIDEWAYS, advancing into the
         Archer's crosshairs is a deadly thing to attempt.

     8)  Call often and realize which player's don't call a lot.
         There are no bonuses for missing days.  Meaning if no
         one calls in five days you can win by advancing to range
         five.  In other words, there are NO make up turns.  If
         you miss a day, that's your tough.

     9)  Know when to hold them and when to fold em.  Save fire
         cards for moving targets, discard junk cards (extra
         terrain) etc.
