                               By Eddie Gaul
                                  AKA Pit Fiend

  Installation for WWIV Boards:
      PF4 is an extremely simple program to install.  I have
      made a listing of the things you must do to install
      PF4 correctly:

        1.  In your ROOT directory of your WWIV you should create
            a batch file called PIT4.BAT.  To create a batch
            file you should type the following at a DOS prompt:
               COPY CON PIT4.BAT.
        2.  Next I am going to assume I have WWIV set up in
            the C:\WWIV and I want to put Pit Fiend IV in
            a directory C:\WWIV\PITSTUF4
            You may have to change the wording above, depending
            upon your configuration.  Perhaps you run yours off
            of Drive D or have it C:\BBS\WWIV, or whatever.

        3.  I am now in the Batch file and will type the following
            things:
               ECHO OFF
               CD PITSTUF4 (go to directort where the PF4 game is!)
               PITADV4 %1 (don't forget the percent sign!!!)
               CD\WWIV (back to the BBS system directory)
               CTRL-Z (don't actually type this, just hit it!)

        4.  Now you screen should say:  1 File Copied.

        5.  Now hopefully you have created the sub-directory
            and have copied the Zip file and its contents
            into that sub-directory.

        6.  Run CPLAYERS.EXE by typing CPLAYERS.  Answer
            the question about the usernumber as best as possible.
            The higher the number of course, the longer it will
            take to search for people, the more space it takes
            on your precious hard drive, but all your users
            will be able to play.

        7.  Now, go into Chainedit and run it.  Of course
            you can set it up by doing the following:
               Filename : C:\WWIV\PIT4.BAT %1 (call the batch file)
               ANSI     : YES
               300 Baud : Sure if you want them to.
               Shrink   : No.
               Dos Inter: Yes

        8.  Bingo, you are set, take a break or start on in,
            after all, the unregistered version has only 3
            games going on at once.  Consider registering
            it for the full 26 and allow people to play in more
            than one game.

        9.  Be sure to check out Section III.

II.  Systems OTHER than WWIV.

Well, this of course uses the CHAIN.TXT that WWIV has been noted
for, but I have not used any of the special colors that WWIV
uses.  All the colors are pure ANSI, so if you have a converter
use it!  I should also mention that this game does NOT check
itself for Hangups or Time Outs.  Quite nicely, WWIV does that
automatically for me so you may also have to use programs
such as Bulldog or Gateway.

Again I know very little about other BBS systems.  I have
called a Telegard board once or twice, but that's it folks.  Seen
Compuserve and stuff like that also, but know very little about it.
If you get my program to work on your system drop me a line or something.

III.  Registering PF4 and Sysop Notes

This program will create more files as the game progresses.  None
should be alarmingly big at all.  There is a message file for each
game which is about 3.5K and the save, which is 800 or so bytes long.
Other than that, you may have to force some people to get a move on
in their games as well.

You may want to put the *.doc files into PIT4DOC.ZIP in the download
section for people to download and read.  Please do not seperate the
documents from the game though.

Registering:
   Here's the scoop:

      If you have registered ANYTHING with me before (PF1-3) you can
      score this game for a mere $5.00 PLUS any upgrades that you
      might be needing for absolutely free (for PF1-3).

      If you haven't registered ANYTHING with me before than you
      have to pay $10.00 to register it.  You will also receive
      a FREE copy of Pit Fiend Adventure's Volume I.  This version
      has several SERIOUS combat bugs fixed, automapping, and in
      short is faster.  Although a few quirks still exist, it
      runs much better than the unregistered one (also won't leave
      loose clusters on your Hard Drive....)

  If you are reading this and wondering what the heck is PF1-3 you
  can send $3.00 and I'll send you the latest versions (unregistered)
  of those games or you can download them from various BBS's like
  Compuserve, Amber, or Genie.  I can be reached for questions
  and comments as 19 @ 2350 on the WWIV net.

  I'd like to thank the following people for help with this game:
    Iron Horse :  for running the very first version of this game
                  and have it lock up your BBS.  Again sorry about
                  this and thanks for the beta site.

    Raelini!   :  Thanks for the Betaing on this one, kinda short
                  on time out there but any beta testing is better
                  than none.  Thanks for the beta testing site
                  and a place to get Net mail.

    Knight Errant, Dragonmaster, Tanis and a bunch of other people,
    thanks for the testing and enthusiasm.  Maybe one day I'll do
    another FRPG like PF3, maybe but I doubt it!

    Author Notes:
       Well this game was programmed in Turbo Pascal 5.5.  First
       game I have written that fit in ONE code segment in a long
       time.  Actually it could have been a COM file but I wanted
       some experience with 5.5.  Took one week to program the whole
       thing (really no joke!), 1700 lines of main code, 3 units,
       and a 7 line main EXE area.  Took 2 weeks to beta and do the
       documentation.

       If you find a bug contact me at 19 @ 2350.  Later!
