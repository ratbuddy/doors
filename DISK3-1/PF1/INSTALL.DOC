                          INSTALLATION AND SYSOP NOTES

                                      For

                               BARBARIAN TALES!

       Batch File:
         This game performs best with SHRINK method.  It is not
         required, but it does work best!  Therefore if you wish
         to put this game in its own sub-directory you must do the
         following things to assure that it can access all of the files.

       1.  Create a batch file called PIT.BAT.  By typing COPY CON
           BARBAR.BAT at the dos prompt in the WWIV sub directory.
           Then type the following things:

           a.  CD\XXXXXXX <---- whatever you decide to name the
               sub directory

           b.  BBN %1

           C.  cd.. (back to the WWIV directory!)

           d.  Ctrl-Z (don't actually type words but just CTRL-Z!)

       2.  This will save the batch file.

     Now make a chain using Chain edit which will call BARBAR.BAT by
     typing the following chain c:\wwiv\BARBAR %1.  When BARBAR.bat is called
     it will then change directories to the one you out the adventure in
     and call it, passing the parms.


     Telegard users and others will have to figure out how to do it
     themselves, as I am not experienced with those systems....

     Initializing the Game:

        This will make sure that the game has not been tampered with or
        a previous user's locations aren't saved.  Type START in DOS.

        This will refresh the location and table data files.

     Chain Requirements:

        This game uses the default for DOS interrupts, which I believe at
        the present moment is yes.  You must use Shrink.  You config.sys
        file must have the string DEVICE = ANSI.SYS in it.  ANSI is a
        requirement for this game!!!!!!  People who can't support ANSI
        will have grave misgivings about the game, as it will shoot
        garbage all over the screen.  It is recommended that 300 baud
        not be allowed to play for obvious reasons....

     Boards Over 750 users!

     If your board has more than user number 750 please do the following:
        1)  Donate at least $5.00 to the address below and tell me how
            many users you do have and I will fix the data files to be
            much bigger.  Send a Xerox copy of the endorsed/cancelled
            check to me.

        2)  Make sure that users who's user number is over 750 cannot
            play the game....

        The data files are 750 records and if use 751 comes along....
        unknown amounts of damage can be done....

     Source Code:
         The Source Code is currently out there and can be found on several
         local BBS's....  Our fixed up version is NOT flawless and we
         are NOT responsible for ANY bugs that it contains or causes!

         This game was downloaded from a board and was compiled and
         did not work....  Many bugs, swear words, and just plain
         inconsistencies caused many problems.  Reaver and yours
         truly have taken this older version of Foodfite and
         reworked it....


                                    Page -2-
         Knowledge of Turbo Pascal is a requirement also for the source
         code, it comes with very little commentation but it should be
         fairly easy to follow.....

     Notes on Files:

        If a user is deleted off your board or decides never to call
        again, or just doesn't want to play do NOT delete the character
        buy conventional ways.... This could cause File Not Found and
        Run Time Errors....
