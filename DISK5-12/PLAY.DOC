                            By Eddie Gaul
                            Aka Pit Fiend

                 Recommended to be Read Carefully!!!!

     First of all I should mention that Pit Fiend's Adventure Volume
     V is VERY different from the previous one.  It is therefore
     important that you read through the documents very carefully.
     This will enable you to win more easily and become leader
     of the Flight of the Dragons!

     When you first start you'll be coming across a something that
     looks sorta like this:


     CLOUD: 1  FIRE: 0                    CLOUD: 3  FIRE: 0

     5.                                   5.
     6.                                   6.


This is a sample game, assumingly caught in the middle of it!
I would like to thank Slyslop, Vision Thing, Lukas, and The Mystic
(friends or very good beta testers).  Anyhow some desciptions of what is
going on are neccessary in order to precede further.  Be patient,
detailed rules are coming up!

We shall start with Slyslop, who is doing fairly well in the game.
He has NO cloud cover, a Fire Wall of +2, 4 Steam Dragons (each with
3 hit points out of three) and 1 Acid dragon at full strength.

Meanwhile The Mystic has one Steam Dragon 1 wounded Magic Using Dragon,
and 2 healthy ones.  He has a cloud cover of 1 with no fire wall.

The dragon types are as follows:
  STM:  Steam Dragon (3 Max HPS)
  ACD:  Acid Dragon  (5 Max HPS)
  MAG:  Magic Using Dragon (7 Max HPS)
  ICE:  Ice Dragon  (8 Max HPS)
  FIR:  Fire Dragon (10 Max Hps)
STM is known as ONE (1) and FIR is known as five (5).
The SLOT NUMBER is the numbers 1-6.  The opponent number is next to the
name (Slyslop is player #4).


So what is a FIRE wall?  A fire wall is assumed to engulf an entire enemy in
flames.  This magic using firewall also effects magic using dragons AND
fire using dragons.  Therefore no immunities.  Each point of fire walls
that you have causes one "invisible" point of damage on EACH of your dragons.
Therefore, each of Slyslop's Steam dragons have 1 hit point left and
his Acid Dragon has 3 left.  If an attack was landed on his steam Dragon's
for 1 point or more, it would be slain!  Therefore it is NOT good to have
a fire wall on you (see card section for rules on how to remove a fire wall).
It is very good to play a fire wall on an opponent.  A failed fire
counts as an action (see Firing).

What is a Cloud?  Well clouds represent protection.  It is also a hinderance.
Anybody that uses a Standard attack (one that uses a straight attack)
has a X in 6 chance of the attack missing.  X is the number of cloud
points.  This is done if the attacker has cloud cover (hinderance to aiming)
and to the defender (cover and hiding).  Therefore, if Vision Thing fired
against Lukas he would first have to make his 1 in 6 chance of bypassing
his own clouds and then if he was successful, pass Lukas's 3 in 6 protection.
Do note that the situation would be reversed if Lukas fired on Vision Thing.
Therefore clouds are not beneficial, they are good if you are severally
weakened.

How do I get rid of a cloud?  Well there is a card called Gust of Wind (GOW,
See cards) which will blow away your cloud or another player's.  Also each
time ANY player logs in there is a 1 in 12 chance that each player's
cloud cover will disappear.

____________________________________________________________________________
Scoring
   You score points by killing dragons.  If you put on the KILLING blow (
   note, you do not get any score for wounding a dragon)  you get that
   dragon's Maximum Hit Points for points.  So if you killed The Mystic's
   wounded Magic Dragon (1/6) you would get 6 points.

   If you wipe out a player's last dragon you score an additional 15 points.

   If you are the last player in your game you score an addition 75 points.

   The game ends when there is but one player left in a game.

   You may examine rankings in the Selection area for (L)istings of players.

_____________________________________________________________________________


HELX - Heal any of your wounded dragons.  They must be wounded.  This does
       NOT constitute an Action for discarding.

CLDS - Place clouds on your opponent.  (or yourself).  The Maximum cloud
       strength is 4.  Playing a cloud is considered an Action.

DLFR - Dispelling a wall of fire is considered an action.  Playing this
       card will reduce your FIRE:  category to a 0, thus no longer wounding
       your dragons.

See FIRE Rules for details on STMX, ACDX, MAGX, ICEX, FIRX

Hero:  Kills any one dragon (select the most beneficial) with a 50%
       chance of success.  Is considered an action.

Archer: Exactly like the Hero card but only has a 33% chance of success.

BONX - Gives your dragon X more maximum hit points.  This is considered an
       action.

RXXX - Reinforces the dragon group in question.  You may have a maximum
       of SIX dragons in a group.  If you have six, you may NOT play
       a reinforcement.  Reinforcements come in with standard hit points
       and are affected by walls of fire and clouds.  Playing a
       reinforcement card does NOT constitute an action.

DAMX - causes an Addition X points of damage on a wounded dragon.  The
       dragon's hit points must actually show that it is wounded.
       Meaning that a Dragon with 5/6 can be hit with a DAMX card.
       Although a dragon with 6/6 hit points with a wall of fire of 1
       CANNOT.  Playing a DAMX card is considered an action.

GOWD - Removes an opponents or your clouds.  It is considered an action
       to play.

WALX - Places a wall of fire on an opponent's dragons.  If the resulting
       wall does enough damage to kill some dragons YOU will score the
       points for any and ALL dragons you kill.  So lets say you
       have 4 steam dragons with 1 hit point left.  You play a WAL2,
       you'd get the points for all 4 steam Dragons.  Walls of fire
       remain in effect until a DLFR (DispeL FiRe) is played.  Of course,
       it is considered an action to play a DLFR.  The Maximum
       wall of fire is 3.


Firing Rules

   When you get a fire card you must have a dragon to use it.
   Meaning to fire a STM1 you must have atleast ONE steam dragon.
   He may be wounded or full strength, but you must have atleast one.
   Therefore you need a fire dragon to use a FIR5 card. If you don't
   have one, then it is a junk card until you get a reinforcement.

   You may conventionally fire at an opponent TWICE in one turn.  You
   may fire with the same dragon as much as you like.  Meaning if you have
   one steam dragon and 5 STM1 cards, you are free to play all of them.
   You may not play more than 2 STM1 cards (or ACDX, FIRX, MAGX, ICEX)
   on the same player.  This eliminates fast killings are allows
   for strategy.  This rules is NEGATED WHEN THERE ARE ONLY TWO (2)
   people left in the game!

   You may though play clouds, fire twice, DAMX once, wall of fire,
   and GOW him all in the same turn though.

   A steam dragon may kill and damage a steam dragon.  There are no
   rules concerning who may attack who. You may NOT attack an
   empty spot though.  Remember, the object of the game is to kill
   for points, to leave a dragon with 1 hit point and then expect
   it to still be there when you come back, somebody just as greedy
   as you will take it.

   When you damage a dragon, keep in mind that the program will automatically
   deduct any damage that may be in effect from a Wall of Fire.
   A dragon is termed Killed when its hit points are <=0.  A dragon's
   hit points never be exceed his maximum hit points.

   Firing whether successful or not (because of clouds), is always
   termed as an action, except when bad input is encountered OR
   a non-existant dragon is used to fire on or upon.
____________________________________________________________________________

Discarding Rules:

   A player may discard up to ALL of his cards if he has NOT played any
   actions this call.  (see what is termed as an action above).
   ONCE YOU HAVE FINISHED DISCARDING, IT IS THE END OF YOUR TURN!!!

____________________________________________________________________________

Reports:
   Seeking Revenge?  Want to know who killed your last fire dragon?
   Want to know who put that Wall of Fire on you?  Check the report
   log by hitting R.  You may read some or all fifty reports.
   Each game has its own report log.

   By reading all of the reports is a clever way to repaint the
   screen from line noise.

   Reading reports DOES NOT count as an action.

Suggested Strategies

     This game requires skill as well as luck.  A dedicated called
     can become the top of the pack in no time at all. Here are some
     suggestions as to how to win in Pit Fiend V.

        1.  Keep up with your games.  Go for points.  Kill somebody
            who has one dragon left.  You score the fifteen points.

        2.  Keep good fire cards while they are handy.  Weaken a dragon
            and let a fool chip it down further and then use that
            fire card to whipe it out.

        3.  Try to get rid of your opponents groups.  Sure Steam
            Dragon's are weak.  Sure they usually do a whopping two
            points of damage, but an opponent is going to be stuck
            with A LOT of junk cards if you can kill his Steam Dragons.
            Kill the last of a group so he can't fire back with
            those cards.  Fire dragons do a lot of damage, sure, but
            there ain't a lot of cards that can be used to fire them!

        4.  Get rid of Wall of Fires.  They aren't good.  Ruthlessly
            kill a player who has a wall of fire on.  His steam
            dragon's are usually dead meat.

        5.  Use Heros/Archers at the most point giving dragons.

        6.  Use Cloud cover to your advantage.  Cloudy up a winning
            person's day by giving him one or two.  It'll make it
            SUPER hard for him to fire out of.

        7.  If you are weak you can still put on a good show.  Sure
            other players may have gotten a better start, better cards,
            but what comes around goes around.  You'll have your
            revenge.  Do the best you can and nab those points!

            Good luck!
