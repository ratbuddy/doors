                              By Eddie Gaul
                                AKA Pit Fiend

  Installation for WWIV Boards:
      PF5 is an extremely simple program to install.  I have
      made a listing of the things you must do to install
      PF5 correctly:

        1.  In your ROOT directory of your WWIV you should create
            a batch file called PIT5.BAT.  To create a batch
            file you should type the following at a DOS prompt:
               COPY CON PIT5.BAT.
        2.  Next I am going to assume I have WWIV set up in
            the C:\WWIV and I want to put Pit Fiend V in
            a directory C:\WWIV\PITSTUF5
            You may have to change the wording above, depending
            upon your configuration.  Perhaps you run yours off
            of Drive D or have it C:\BBS\WWIV, or whatever.

        3.  I am now in the Batch file and will type the following
            things:
               ECHO OFF
               CD PITSTUF5 (go to directort where the PF5 game is!)
               PITADV5 %1 (don't forget the percent sign!!!)
               CD\WWIV (back to the BBS system directory)
               CTRL-Z (don't actually type this, just hit it!)

        4.  Now you screen should say:  1 File(s) Copied.

        5.  Now hopefully you have created the sub-directory
            and have copied the Zip file and its contents
            into that sub-directory.

        6.  Besure to type REROLL.BAT.  This will run
            a program called CGAMES and delete old save files
            (if any).

            Run CPLAYERS.EXE by typing CPLAYERS.  Answer
            the question about the usernumber as best as possible.
            The higher the number of course, the longer it will
            take to search for people, and the more space it takes
            on your hard drive, but all your users will be able to play.
            Do note, that later if you get more users, then you alotted
            the game will have to be rerolled!

        7.  Now, go into Chainedit and run it.  Of course
            you can set it up by doing the following:
               Filename : C:\WWIV\PIT5.BAT %1 (call the batch file)
               ANSI     : YES
               300 Baud : Sure if you want them to.
               Shrink   : No.
               Dos Inter: Yes

        8.  Bingo, you are set, take a break or start on in.
            Remember that you are allowed to play only one game
            and registering it will enable you to play in more than
            one game which makes extremely fun competition.

        9.  Be sure to check out Section III.

   II.  Systems OTHER than WWIV.

   Well, this of course uses the CHAIN.TXT that WWIV has been noted
   for, but I have not used any of the special colors that WWIV
   uses.  All the colors are pure ANSI, so if you have a converter
   use it!  I should also mention that this game does NOT check
   itself for Hangups or Time Outs.  Quite nicely, WWIV does that
   automatically for me so you may also have to use programs
   such as Bulldog or Gateway.  To my knowledge, this game works
   fine with Celerity BBS systems with a conversion program.

   Again I know very little about other BBS systems.  I have
   called a Telegard board once or twice, but that's it folks.  Seen
   Compuserve and stuff like that also, but know very little about it.
   If you get my program to work on your system drop me a line or something.

   III.  Registering PF5 and Sysop Notes

   This program will create more files as the game progresses.  None
   should be alarmingly big at all.  There is a message file for each
   game which is about 3.5K and the save, which is 800 or so bytes long.
   Other than that, you may have to force some people to get a move on
   in their games as well.  You can use the program called DELETER
   to delete games.  Just run it and you will be guided through a listing
   of the games whereupon you can make room for new people.

   You may want to put the *.doc files into PIT5DOC.ZIP in the download
   section for people to download and read.  Please do not seperate the
   documents from the game though as this game will display them if a person
   wants to view them.

   Registering:
      Here's the scoop:

      If you have registered ANYTHING with me before (PF1-4) you can
      score this game for a mere $5.00 PLUS any upgrades that you
      might be needing for absolutely free (for PF1-4).

      If you haven't registered ANYTHING with me before than you
      have to pay $10.00 to register it.  You will also receive
      a FREE copy of Pit Fiend Adventure's Volume I.  This version
      has several SERIOUS combat bugs fixed, has automapping, and in
      short is faster.  Although a few quirks still exist, it
      runs much better than the unregistered one (also won't leave
      loose clusters on your Hard Drive....)

  If you are reading this and wondering what the heck is PF1-4 you
  can send $4.00 and I'll send you the latest versions (unregistered)
  of those games or you can download them from various BBS's like
  Compuserve, Amber, or Genie.  I can be reached for questions
  and comments as 19 @ 2350 on the WWIV net.

  A place to download all the latest versions of Pit Fiend's Adventures
  is:
      Mindcraft BBS (213) 320-5196 (2400-300) no ratios, easy validation.

  I'd like to thank the following people for help with this game:
    General Zennor, Iron Horse, Milamber, Mystic, Eldritch, and many
    many others who played the game and in short tested the balance
    of the game.

    Author Notes:
       Well this game was programmed in Turbo Pascal 5.5 and
       Assembly.  First game I have written that fit in ONE code
       segment in a long time.  Actually it could have been a
       COM file but I wanted some experience with 5.5.  Took one
       week to program the whole thing (really no joke!),
       1700 lines of main code, 2 units, and a 7 line main EXE area.

       If you find a bug contact me at 19 @ 2350, I usually offer
       discounts to those that are the first to report a bug to me
       that is serious enough to warrant a new version.  Special
       thanks to Socrates way out in Louisiana for his help in finding
       several serious bugs in the unregistered versions of Pit Fiend's
       Adventures Volume IV.

          Latest Versions of Pit Fiend Games:
             Volume 1 -- Version C
             Volume 2 -- Version C
             Volume 3 -- Version B
             Volume 4 -- Version D
          If you are running a version different from one of those,
          it is highly recommend that you get the latest to avoid
          errors.  Keep in touch with the WWIV onliner NET discussion.
          As I usually post bugs and/or problems that can be easily
          corrected.
