      When you first start Pit Fiend V you may be prompted
      by a something that looks like this:

           Welcome to PF V, Pit Fiend!
           You are Currently in Game A
           Choices:
           (D)ocumentation

           (V)iew People in a game
           Choice:

       You pick you selection by hitting the appropriate letter.

         Documentation:  You can get help by reading this.
         You will be given a choice of the various instructions
         files and their relevance to the game.

         Listings of People:  This little feature will pick
         out everybody that has ever logged into the game and
         show their total points and also display
         their rankings if you wish.  Also you may look at the
         top ten players to determine who is the best dragon
         flight leader.

         Quit:  Returns you back to the BBS.

         Play:  If there are FOUR (4) people in a game you will be
         allowed to play.  If you have been killed you still cannot
         join another game until it is finished.  Once the game
         is finished you are free to choose a new game.
         A game can only be played if and only if there are four
         people in it.

         Remove Self:  If you have Signed up for a game and there
         are not FOUR players in it, you can remove yourself from it.
         If there are four players in it and the game has not yet
         begun you cannot remove yourself.

         Sign Up for a Game:  If there are NOT FOUR (4) people in a game
         you can add yourself into the game.  When there are four people
         in it the game will comence.  If you are the fourth person, you
         will get the first turn.

  Object of the Game:
    The object of the game is to do ONE of the following two things:
       a) Kill everybody in the game
       b) Score as many points as you can by killing enemies.

  You can only play a game ONCE per day.  Technically, you can play
  twice in twenty-four hours though, that is you can play at 6:00pm
  on a Monday and 6:00am on Tuesday.  Once you enter a game by hitting
  P, your time is updated, so if you get disconnected or quit by
  accident, then you must wait till the next day to play again.
  (This prevents players from hanging up on a game if things don't
  go their way).
