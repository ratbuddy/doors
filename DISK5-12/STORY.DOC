                               by Eddie Gaul
                               AKA Pit Fiend
                               (C) 1991

     While the world raged war on the lands and mighty dwarven,
     elven, and human empires conquered and fell in the long battles
     a new form of combat took place.  Although the evil presence of
     Pit Fiend was vanquished long ago by heroic adventurers evil
     still flourished.

     In the midst of a battle it came about that a wizard by the name
     of Anthraxius, of gnome race, opened a gate to another dimension.
     Long ago, thought impossible, he rediscovered a way to set dragon's
     free from the evil planes where they lived in multitude.
     His conjurings came to popular knowledge when his assistant
     Megadefis sold the secrets to various armies of human, elven,
     and dwarven races.

     These secrets were used to further the war against each other
     as the land became more ruined and scarred as the dragon's were
     trained to fight each other, as well as the enemy.  Great aeriel
     battles broke out over towns such as Apple Valley, where Hermit Noze
     proclaimed that the world was at an end, that this was far worse
     than the evil that Pit Fiend has once wreaked upon the lands
     of Californica.

     The Fire Dragons, the most demonic of all the five types blew
     fire over cities and burned guilty and innocent alike in infernos
     of fire.  Where the Steam Dragons patrolled water ways.
     Other dragon such as the Ice, Magic Using, and Acid dragons
     guarded their respective territories.
