                   INSTALLATION, SYSOP, REGISTERATION NOTES

                                    For

                         PIT FIEND'S ADVENTURE VOLUME 2

          How to Install:

            Pit Fiend's Onliner comes with many files.  Most of them are
          Dungeon Files or Data files.  It will create more as the game is
          being played, such as *.SAV files.  It is recommended that
          you read this carefully so that you can save Hard Disk Space and
          organize your hard Drive Directories Efficiently.

          Settup up the Chain.

          (A) Batch File:

            1.  Create a batch file called PIT2.BAT.  By typing COPY CON
                PIT2.BAT at the DOS prompt in the WWIV sub directory.
                Then type the following things: (seperated by carriage
                returns)

                a.  CD XXXXXXX <---- whatever you decide to name the
                    sub directory (possibly PITONL2); longest the game
                    batch file switches directories to whatever
                    directory ALL the files are in.  Can be any drive,
                    or directory!

                b.  PITONL2 %1 (the name of the COM file)

                C.  cd.. (back to the WWIV directory!)

                d.  Ctrl-Z (don't actually type words but just CTRL-Z!)
                    This saves the batch file to your hard drive.

            2.  This will save the batch file.

         Now make a chain using WWIV's Chainedit which will call PIT.BAT by
         typing the following chain c:\wwiv\pit2 %1.  When pit2.bat is called
         it will then change directories to the one you out the adventure in
         and call it, passing the neccessary parms.  This method is also
         used by Global Wars, if you are confused by it, compare it to the
         one use by it.  Also note that the Shrink Method is NOT required to
         play the game.

          Telegard users and others will have to figure out how to do it
          themselves, as I am not experienced with those systems....
          As of 6/19/1990 I know of ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO RUN THIS ON
          TELEGARD!  SO I DON'T KNOW!
                                          Page -1-


          Initializing the Game:

             This will make sure that the game has not been tampered with or
             a previous user's locations aren't saved.  Type REROLL2 in
             game directory.

             This will refresh the table, magic mouth, and
             weather data files.  It will also erase all files ending in the
             extension *.SAV --> VERY IMPORTANT.  (if they are in
             the same sub directory as the onliner).

             You can also run CMMOUTH.COM to renew the magic mouth incase
             you don't like what somebody said!  Note that PIT2 does not
             check your TRASHCAN.TXT file, but it does report that kind of
             stuff to your log, be sure to check it if you have a problem
             with swearing.

          Chain Requirements:

             This game uses the default for DOS interrupts, which I believe at
             the present moment is yes.  Your config.sys
             file must have the string DEVICE = ANSI.SYS in it.  ANSI is a
             requirement for this game!!!!!!  People who can't support ANSI
             will have grave misgivings about the game, as it will shoot
             garbage all over the screen.  It is recommended that 300 baud
             not be allowed to play for obvious reasons....

          Boards Over 750 users!

          If your board has more than user number 750 please do the following:
             1)  Register it to the address below and tell me how
                 many users you do have and I will fix the data files to be
                 much bigger.

             2)  Make sure that users who's user number is over 750 cannot
                 play the game....

             The data files are 750 records and if use 751 comes along....
             unpredictable results will occur....

          Notes on Files:

             If a user is deleted off your board or decides never to call
             again, or just doesn't want to play can delete the character
             by conventional ways.... Using VIEWCHR2.EXE will do the trick
             but you may use DOS's erase or Del command.

             Use the Character Editor to destroy them, entitled VIEWCHAR.EXE
             Viewchar is meant to be used for these reasons, or for cheating.

             Note that #.SAV are saved by the character's
             user number.  Make sure you know the character's user number.
                                      Page -2-
          Notes on Viewchr2.EXE (registered Versions only)

             This is not an onliner program, it will hang the board if it is
             used as one.  Viewchar allows the sysop or anyone else for that
             matter at the keyboard to modify there character to drastic
             measures.... having given one of my characters a 200 strength,
             made me nearly invincible.  I suggest using it with caution.

             It was made to repair characters who had been hurt by a bug or
             just wanted to get a helping hand.  A score greater than 20 in
             any attribute is very good.

             Viewchar should be handled with care, giving a character an
             massive amount of anything will spoil the user's ability to enjoy
             the game!  If you find the monsters are too tough or you want
             a "walk-thru" character use it!  It will not allow you to modify
             a character's dungeon location, as this is a confusing process
             which most likely you will screw up on and put the character in
             a nonexistant dungeon OR in a dungeon where he can't escape!

             When running Viewchar be sure that it can get to all the *.DAT
             files in the sub directory, it will need to load all the potions
             and weapons (etc).  Naturally it must have access to the the
             *.SAV files!

          Bugs and etc..


          If you find a bug in the game (and I know there still are some,
          nobody's perfect) please write me at the following address with a
          good description of where, how, and etc this thing happened.  I will
          try to make a fix on it ASAP.

          If you do find a bug and it is relatively minor, try to avoid it, as
          I will only send out a new version if it is a major bug...

          Notes on PF2 bugs:  More than likely the source of the bug is in
          a data file... if it is a single room that glitches out or something
          have the user avoid that room, if that room is necessary in
          completing the dungeon please inform me.  Usually when a "ROOM"
          problem comes up a bunch on high digit numbers will shoot over the
          screen....  The user can abort out of combat by hitting 'Z'.  
          Checking programs have been run to check for this kind of stuff....
          but perhaps a bad download or something....
     
          To get in touch with me concerning registration,
          questions, hints, etc please write, I prefer that you do not call,
          as I am rarily home and WILL NOT return long distance phone calls.

          My address is:  Eddie Gaul
                          2917 Via Rivera

Notes for Pit Fiend Volume I Stuff:  Note that most of the in the first
adventure is NOT (I repeat NOT) compatible in the slightest with PF2.
Using VIEWCHAR from PF1 on Pit2 characters could have DISASTROUS results
(of which I do not want to predict....) and using characters from PF1
in PF2 is not possible.  Please make Pf1 and PF2 SEPERATE and distinct
games....  Upon request I may make a convertion program to transport
characters from one game to the other.
                *****          ******       *****

REGISTERATION:  Well the copy of this game that you have right now
is roughly a fourth to a sixth of the game.  In other words you do not
have the entire game.  It is currently UNSOLVEABLE without registeration.
You have two of the 14-18 dungeons in the game and 2 of the 10 or so
cities.  Roughly the entire game takes 500-700K to run.... if a lot of
player play it might be guessed at one megabyte.

To register the game please send $20.00 US dollars in Cash, Money Order
(preferred M.O.), or check (allow two weeks or so for it to clear).
The registered version will be available sometime around July 25, 1990, or
so...  Send the money to my address:

     Eddie Gaul
     2917 Via Rivera
     Palos Verdes Estates, CA 90274

along with the following information:

     The BBS NAME and the Phone Number that you are registering it for:

     And an additional Option:  Saving Automaps... an automap takes up
     roughly 1.8K or so.... of harddisk room PER PLAYER!  The player will
     have the option of saving the automap but it will cost you some
     hard Disk room.  This may or may not be in the registered version,
     depending upon time considerations etc.

     The Registered Version has the following enchancements:

     More Cities, More Wilderness, Boating (currently closed in the
     unregistered version), More Dungeons, the Character Editor, the
     ability to copy chars to and from a down load directory so that two
     boards with registered copies can transport characters back and forth.
     If I feel particularily daring I will put back character vs. character
     combat... but don't bet on it.  Also you will get a Weather.COM file
     which when run will go through the wilderness maps and check the
     weather information file and make modifications.....  If it has
     been particularily hot or dry etc the maps will change.

     I will then send you a disk (3.5 or 5 1/4 (specify)) with the
     Zipped file on it.  Currently the game is roughly 210K Zipped
     at roughly 7/8's through....

     I will NOT send a copy of the game to registeree's without a
     BBS's name and number.

     Also do note that PF1 Enhanced will soon be available, consult
     the documentation on how to get a copy of that for your board.
